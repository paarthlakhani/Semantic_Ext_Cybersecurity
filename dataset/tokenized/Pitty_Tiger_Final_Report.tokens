Today NN O

Pitty NNP O
Tiger NNP O

a DT O

that WDT O

They PRP O

several JJ O

such JJ O

also RB O
at IN O

We PRP O
have VBP O

able JJ O

this DT O

Our PRP$ O

that IN O

not RB O

Our PRP$ O

that IN O
Pitty NNP O

with IN O

Pitty NNP O
Tiger NNP O
is VBZ O
probably RB O
not RB O
a DT O
state-sponsored JJ O

They PRP O

that IN O

would MD O
expect VB O

state-sponsored JJ O

We PRP O
suppose VBP O
this DT O

is VBZ O
opportunistic JJ O

sells VBZ O

probable JJ O

We PRP O

several JJ O

fairly RB O
small JJ O

which WDT O

probably RB O
why WRB O
we PRP O
saw VBD O
them PRP O

a DT O
very RB O
limited JJ O

At IN O

we PRP O

The DT O

describes VBZ O

the DT O

do VBP O

It PRP O
can MD O
be VB O
summarized VBN O
by IN O
the DT O
following JJ O
scheme NN O

The DT O
reconnaissance NN O
phase NN O
commences VBZ O
when WRB O
an DT O
attacker NN O
selects VBZ O
a DT O
new JJ O

involves VBZ O
the DT O
acquisition NN O
of IN O

There EX O
is VBZ O
very RB O

, , O
and CC O
there EX O
is VBZ O

The DT O
only JJ O
way NN O

this DT O

would MD O
be VB O

this DT O

which WDT O

hardly RB O

The DT O

be VB O

This DT O

both DT O
about IN O
finding VBG O

the DT O

successfully RB O

about RB O

which WDT O

accelerate VB O

This DT O

At IN O
this DT O
stage NN O

the DT O

a DT O

The DT B-Entity

might MD O

to TO O
see VB O

We PRP O
suspect VBP O

We PRP O
have VBP O

only RB O
had VBD O
access NN O

three CD O

Therefore RB O

we PRP O
suppose VBP O
the DT O

could MD O
have VB O
more JJR O

what WP O
we PRP O

We PRP O
also RB O

During IN O
the DT O

our PRP$ O

we PRP O
discovered VBD O

According VBG O

the DT O

we PRP O
do VBP O

we PRP O
