In IN O

In IN O
such JJ O

the DT O

Unfortunately RB O
this DT O

through IN O

fully RB O
protect VB O

In IN O

If IN O

are VBP O
not RB O
directly RB O

, , O
the DT O
method NN O
of IN O
choice NN O
for IN O
these DT O
types NNS O
of IN O

is VBZ O
usually RB O
through IN O
a DT O

, , O
which WDT O
provides VBZ O
a DT O

the DT O

This DT O
allows VBZ O

spread VB B-Action

If IN O

truly RB O

this DT O

the DT O

therefore RB O

no RB O

With IN O
the DT O
increasing VBG O

for IN O

now RB O

many JJ O

New JJ O

allowing VBG O

During IN O

the DT O

Subsequently NNP O
the DT O

Some DT O

The DT O

The DT B-Entity

There EX O
are VBP O
two CD O

One CD O
is VBZ O
to TO O

where WRB O

The DT B-Entity
second JJ I-Entity
method NN I-Entity

which WDT O

gaining VBG O

is VBZ B-Action
watering VBG B-Entity

where WRB O
the DT B-Entity
attacker NN I-Entity
infects VBZ B-Action
a DT B-Entity

that WDT I-Entity

a DT I-Entity

By IN O
using VBG B-Action

any DT I-Entity

of IN I-Entity
such JJ I-Entity

, , O
the DT B-Entity
attacker NN I-Entity
can MD O
reduce VB O
the DT O
number NN O
of IN O

bring VB O

a DT O

quantity NN O
which WDT O

manually RB O
at IN O

Some DT B-Entity

For IN O

the DT O

stopped VBD O

after IN O
Microsoft NNP O
released VBD O

This DT O
helped VBD O

cover VB O
their PRP$ O

avoid VB O
unwanted JJ O

A DT O

For IN O

This DT O
can MD O
enable VB O
the DT B-Entity

of IN I-Entity
legitimate JJ I-Entity

Once RB B-Modifier

installs VBZ I-Entity
the DT I-Entity
genuine JJ I-Entity
looking VBG I-Entity

the DT B-Entity
attacker NN I-Entity
effectively RB O
gains VBZ B-Action

Due JJ O
