does VBZ O
not RB O

It PRP O
is VBZ O
possible JJ O
that IN O
regime-linked JJ O

are VBP O
trying VBG O
a DT O

However RB O

given VBN O

this DT O

In IN O

it PRP O
would MD O
be VB O

to TO O
undertake VB O

Taken VBN O
together RB O

we PRP O
find VBP O
this DT O
evidence NN O
supports VBZ O
the DT O
hypothesis NN O
that IN O
familiar JJ O

did VBD O
not RB O
conduct VB O
the DT O

RSS NN O

Currently NNP O

In IN O

ISIS NNP O
supporters NNS O
have VBP O
explicitly RB O
suggested VBN O
that IN O
the DT O

is VBZ O
under IN O
surveillance NN O
and CC O
actively RB O

Together RB O
this DT O
evidence NN O
suggests VBZ O
that IN O
ISIS NNP O
has VBZ O
a DT O
strong JJ O
motivation NN O
for IN O
using VBG O
social JJ O
engineering NN O
and/or CC O

to TO O
locate VB O
the DT O

We PRP O
think VBP O
there EX O
are VBP O
several JJ O
features NNS O
of IN O
the DT O

that IN O
align NN O
with IN O
the DT O

of IN O
ISIS NNP O

more RBR O

than IN O
other JJ O

as IN O
we PRP O
understand VBP O
them PRP O

For IN O
example NN O
: : O
The DT B-Entity
malware NN I-Entity
beacons NNS B-Action
location NN B-Entity
but CC O
does VBZ O
not RB O
provide VB O
RAT NN O

The DT B-Entity
seeding NN I-Entity
attempts VBZ O
to TO O
obtain VB B-Action
a DT B-Entity

from IN B-Modifier

The DT B-Entity
malware NN I-Entity
exfiltrates VBZ B-Action

an DT B-Entity

, , O
thus RB O
not RB O
requiring VBG O

maintain VB O

The DT O

however RB O

We PRP O
speculate VBP O
that IN O

they PRP O

unmasking VBG O

collecting VBG O

would MD O
be VB O
a DT O
more RBR O

ISIS NNP O

Knowing VBG O
