One CD O
possible JJ O

that IN O

According VBG O

Based VBN O

The NNP O

In IN O
other JJ O

any DT O

originating VBG O
in IN O

can MD O
be VB O
assumed VBN O

For IN O
this DT O
reason NN O
, , O
according VBG O
to TO O
defectors NNS O

the DT O
regime NN O

cyber NN O

do VBP O
not RB O

For IN O
this DT O

there EX O
is VBZ O
a DT O
low JJ O
probability NN O

This DT O
implies VBZ O
two CD O
