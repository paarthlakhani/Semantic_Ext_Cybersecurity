This DT O

First NNP O
of IN O
all DT O

it PRP O

the DT O
strict JJ O

obfuscatory JJ O

By IN O

Another DT O
factor NN O
which WDT O
is VBZ O
out IN O
of IN O
character NN O
is VBZ O
the DT O
coding VBG O

All DT O

This DT O

can MD O
be VB O
forged VBN O

and CC O
indeed RB O

all DT O

However RB O

to TO O
a DT O
better JJR O

than IN O
the DT O

Then RB O
there EX O

the DT B-Entity

not RB O

This DT O
means VBZ O
that IN O
the DT O

distributed VBD O

that WDT O

( CD O

Because IN O
of IN O
all PDT O
this DT O
we PRP O
consider VBP O

an DT O
unreliable JJ O

It PRP O

At IN O
one CD O

the DT O
