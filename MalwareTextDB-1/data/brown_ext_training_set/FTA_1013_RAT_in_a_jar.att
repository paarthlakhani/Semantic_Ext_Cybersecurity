In the past two weeks , we have observed an increase in attack activity against the U.S. state and local government , technology , advisory services , health , and financial sectors through phishing emails with what appears to be a remote access trojan ( RAT ) known as Unrecom . 
The attack has also been observed against the financial sector in Saudi Arabia and Russia . 
1 As Unrecom is a comprehensive multi-platform Java-based remote access tool , currently not detected by most AntiVirus products , it presents a risk to a large number of potential victims , regardless of operating system . 
The following is a screenshot of the Unrecom RAT v.2.0 ( Version in Spanish ) : Over time , various reports in the community have documented the evolution of this tool . 
This evolution is to be expected , but its low detection rate , recent use this month through phishing emails campaigns against multiple sectors in the U.S. and association with past campaigns involving a variety of RATs captured our attention . 
The evolution of Unrecom RAT dates from its beginnings as a tool known as Frutas RAT , subsequently branded as Adwind RAT , and now Unrecom RAT . 
In 2013 , it was reported that Frutas RAT was used in phishing email campaigns against high profile 2 companies in Europe and Asia in sectors such as finance , mining , telecom , and government . 
Unrecom RAT provides the attacker with full control over the compromised system , once infected . 
It has some of the following capabilities : In the past , variants of the DarkComet and AcromRAT malware have also been observed beaconing to the same Command & Control ( CnC ) servers used by the Unrecom RAT in this campaign . 
This document will provide information about the recent phishing campaigns observed with this RAT and some of the network indicators . 
The increased threat activity against the U.S. state and local government , technology , advisory services , and health sectors in the past two weeks is of great concern to us as it is being carried through phishing emails with what appears to be a tool known as Unrecom RAT . 
The phishing emails try to trick the users into thinking the emails are legitimate by attaching the RAT with the some of the following names : Payment Invoice.jar , Payment details.jar , POR # 94586.zip/POR # 94586.jar , INV # 94586.zip/INV # 94586.jar , Invitation.jar , reports-pdf.jar , US $ 25k.jar , and DBC_BANK_IMG_23456_156.jar , and lremit_Transfer_Error_Page.jar . 
Some of the email message subjects observed during this campaign are : It appears that the latest version of this RAT is 3.2 and is being sold at `` unrecom [ . 
] net '' for $ 500 ( Enterprise Version ) and $ 200 ( Full Version ) . 
We find it interesting that on their website , the authors of this software recommend Unrecom RAT buyers to not scan created servers ( malware deployed to Victim systems ) at Virustotal nor Metascan . 
This is indicative of the adaptive , counter-intelligence techniques being adopted as threat actors become aware that many security researchers use these services to gather threat intelligence . 
8 Significantly , malware objects seen in previous campaigns like DarkComet and ArcomRAT have also been observed beaconing to the same CnC servers Unrecom RAT is currently using . 
DarkComet is 6,7 known to be a popular RAT used in threat activity in the Middle East . 
A remote access tool provides an attacker with full control over the victim system . 
Once a system has been compromised , the attacker may install one or more backdoors . 
These backdoors provide a persistent foothold , using a separate command and control channel ; allowing future access less likely to be correlated to the original activity . 
Through its modular plugin framework , this particular tool lets the attacker obtain System Information ( e.g . 
IP , OS version , memory RAM information , Java version , Computer Name , User account compromised , etc . 
) , Upload & Execute additional malware , Capture Webcam , Remote Desktop , File Manager , Browser Password Recovery , Capture Microphone , Keylogger , etc . 
The following will present detailed information about some of the phishing emails observed and the attached malware : The `` Invitation.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : The `` Invitation.jar '' malware beaconed to `` magnumbiz.no-ip [ . 
] biz '' over port `` 1505 '' . 
The `` Payment details.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : The `` Payment details.jar '' malware beaconed to `` morechedder.no-ip [ . 
] org '' over port `` 100 '' . 
The `` reports-pdf.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : The `` reports-pdf.jar '' malware beaconed to `` 184.22.201 [ . 
] 27 '' over port `` 3030 '' . 
The `` US $ 25k.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The `` US $ 25k.jar '' malware beaconed to `` toba.no-ip [ . 
] biz '' over port `` 1505 '' . 
The `` Payment Invoice.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The `` Payment Invoice.jar '' malware beaconed to `` greengreen1.no-ip [ . 
] biz '' over port `` 100 '' . 
The `` INV # 94586.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The `` INV # 94586.jar '' malware beaconed to `` 192.95.21 [ . 
] 44 '' over port `` 1511 '' . 
-­‐ Hold-transactions-pdf.jar , and verification-docx.jar The `` Hold-transactions-pdf.jar/verification-docx.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : The `` Hold-transactions-pdf.jar/verification-docx.jar '' malware beaconed to `` 184.22.201 [ . 
] 27 '' over port `` 3030 '' . 
The `` DBC_BANK_IMG_23456_156.jar '' malware is a corrupted file , but it was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : The `` lremit_Transfer_Error_Page.jar '' malware was sent in a phishing email that contained some of the following details : The following is a screenshot of the email : `` Iremit Transfer Error Page '' , in the above email , has a link pointing to `` http : //radaxis [ . 
] by/images/sola/httpsiremit.com.aui-remit-to-the-philippines-cheapest-remittance- service-for-pinoy-in-australi.zip '' The `` lremit_Transfer_Error_Page.jar '' malware beaconed to `` resultpage92.no-ip [ . 
] biz '' over port `` 5353 '' . 
One simple example of how the emails in this phishing campaign are related is that the Command and Control node ( 184.22.201 [ . 
] 27 ) that the malware communicates with is shared by two separate phishing emails in this campaign , as shown in the diagram below . 
Beginning at the top of the diagram and working down , on the left side of the diagram are two phishing emails , the details of which are referenced in the pages above as item numbers 2 & 3 . 
Of note , these phishing emails were sent to users at two separate and unrelated organizations . 
As you can see , when compared to each other , these messages appear completely unrelated , other than the fact they both contain jar files that are sophomorically `` obfuscated '' as pdf.jar files . 
Note that both the subjects , `` Transfer investigation report '' and `` Confirm transactions before release '' are comparatively unique as are the senders , `` Police Department '' cmmds @ sbt.co [ . 
] in and Arthur Anderson alexanderharolds @ arthurandersen [ . 
] com . 
In addition to the fact that the emails share no attributes , the malicious attachments are also unrelated . 
Finally , and of most interest in this diagram , the central node at the bottom of the diagram , represents the Command and Control node ( 184.22.201 [ . 
] 27 ) used by these two examples . 
While this shared resource is noteworthy , of particular interest is that it has also been used in other campaigns . 
8 On the right side of the diagram are files used in two other campaigns using the ArcomRAT and 6,7 DarkComet , The fact that they share the same command-and-control infrastructure as the UnrecomRat campaign make this central node all the more interesting . 
This paper seeks to highlight this campaign targeting significant enterprises worldwide , utilizing a Java- based RAT malware that is currently detected by a small set of security tools . 
We are publishing these indicators so that others in the security research community can monitor for this activity and potentially correlate against other campaigns and tools that are being investigated . 
Fidelis XPS™ , the Advanced Threat Defense solution from General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions detects all of the activity documented in this paper . 
The Fidelis Threat Research Team will continue to follow this specific activity and actively monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape for the latest threats to our customers ' security .
