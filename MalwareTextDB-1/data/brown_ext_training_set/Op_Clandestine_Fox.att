FireEye Research Labs identified a new Internet Explorer ( IE ) zero-day exploit used in targeted attacks . 
The vulnerability affects IE6 through IE11 , but the attack is targeting IE9 through IE11 . 
This zero-day bypasses both ASLR and DEP . 
Microsoft has assigned CVE-2014-1776 to the vulnerability and released security advisory to track this issue . 
Threat actors are actively using this exploit in an ongoing campaign which we have named `` Operation Clandestine Fox . 
'' However , for many reasons , we will not provide campaign details . 
But we believe this is a significant zero day as the vulnerable versions represent about a quarter of the total browser market . 
We recommend applying a patch once available . 
According to NetMarket Share , the market share for the targeted versions of IE in 2013 were : IE 9 13.9 % IE 10 11.04 % IE 11 1.32 % Collectively , in 2013 , the vulnerable versions of IE accounted for 26.25 % of the browser market . 
The vulnerability , however , does appear in IE6 through IE11 though the exploit targets IE9 and higher . 
The exploit leverages a previously unknown use-after-free vulnerability , and uses a well-known Flash exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and bypass Windows ' ASLR and DEP protections . 
The exploit page loads a Flash SWF file to manipulate the heap layout with the common technique heap feng shui . 
It allocates Flash vector objects to spray memory and cover address 0×18184000 . 
Next , it allocates a vector object that contains a flash.Media.Sound ( ) object , which it later corrupts to pivot control to its ROP chain . 
The SWF file calls back to Javascript in IE to trigger the IE bug and overwrite the length field of a Flash vector object in the heapspray . 
The SWF file loops through the heapspray to find the corrupted vector object , and uses it to again modify the length of another vector object . 
This other corrupted vector object is then used for subsequent memory accesses , which it then uses to bypass ASLR and DEP . 
With full memory control , the exploit will search for ZwProtectVirtualMemory , and a stack pivot ( opcode 0×94 0xc3 ) from NTDLL . 
It also searches for SetThreadContext in kernel32 , which is used to clear the debug registers . 
This technique , documented here , may be an attempt to bypass protections that use hardware breakpoints , such as EMET 's EAF mitigation . 
With the addresses of the aforementioned APIs and gadget , the SWF file constructs a ROP chain , and prepends it to its RC4 decrypted shellcode . 
It then replaces the vftable of a sound object with a fake one that points to the newly created ROP payload . 
When the sound object attempts to call into its vftable , it instead pivots control to the attacker 's ROP chain . 
The ROP payload basically tries to make memory at 0×18184000 executable , and to return to 0x1818411c to execute the shellcode . 
Inside the shellcode , it saves the current stack pointer to 0×18181800 to safely return to the caller . 
Then , it restores the flash.Media.Sound vftable and repairs the corrupted vector object to avoid application crashes . 
The shellcode also recovers the ESP register to make sure the stack range is in the current thread stack base/limit . 
The shellcode calls SetThreadContext to clear the debug registers . 
It is possible that this is an attempt to bypass mitigations that use the debug registers . 
The shellcode calls URLDownloadToCacheFileA to download the next stage of the payload , disguised as an image . 
Using EMET may break the exploit in your environment and prevent it from successfully controlling your computer . 
EMET versions 4.1 and 5.0 break ( and/or detect ) the exploit in our tests . 
Enhanced Protected Mode in IE breaks the exploit in our tests . 
EPM was introduced in IE10 . 
Additionally , the attack will not work without Adobe Flash . 
Disabling the Flash plugin within IE will prevent the exploit from functioning . 
The APT group responsible for this exploit has been the first group to have access to a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits ( e.g . 
IE , Firefox , and Flash ) in the past . 
They are extremely proficient at lateral movement and are difficult to track , as they typically do not reuse command and control infrastructure . 
They have a number of backdoors including one known as Pirpi that we previously discussed here . 
CVE-2010-3962 , then a 0-day exploit in Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , and 8 dropped the Pirpi payload discussed in this previous case . 
As this is still an active investigation we are not releasing further indicators about the exploit at this time .
