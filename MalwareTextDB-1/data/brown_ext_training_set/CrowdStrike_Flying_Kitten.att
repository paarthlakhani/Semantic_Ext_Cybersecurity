Today , our friends at FireEye released a report on an Iran-based adversary they are calling Saffron Rose . 
CrowdStrike Intelligence has also been tracking and reporting internally on this threat group since mid- January 2014 under the name FLYING KITTEN , and since that time has seen targeting of multiple U.S.- based defense contractors as well as political dissidents . 
FireEye 's report notes that this adversary 's targeted intrusion activity consists of credential theft and malware delivery individually . 
The FLYING KITTEN campaigns investigated by CrowdStrike Intelligence showed that the actor actually combines the two . 
For example , the adversary will register a domain that spoofs the name of the targeted organization and then host a spoofed login page on that site . 
The page is used to steal legitimate credentials , but once users enter the credentials , they are often redirected to a new page that prompts them to download a `` Browser Patch '' or other similar type of file . 
The downloaded file is actually the Stealer malware that exfiltrates stolen data to an FTP server . 
In addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting , it also appears that FLYING KITTEN is also engaged in broader targeting via the website parmanpower [ . 
] com . 
This website is registered via the same registrant email ( info [ @ ] usa.gov.us ) and other Whois information as some of the other domains related to the activity discussed above . 
It purports to be the website of a business engaged in recruiting , training , and development in Erbil , Iraq . 
No malicious activity has been linked to this domain , however , the fact that it was registered under the same registrant email at the same time as other FLYING KITTEN domains linked to malicious activity , it is likely that the adversary is using this site for malicious purposes as well . 
The website does not appear to deliver any malware , so its most likely purpose is to act as a credential-collection mechanism much like the spoofed Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) Aerospace Conference website ( aeroconf2014 [ . 
] org ) the adversary used earlier this year . 
This spoofed recruiting company website could be used to target entities across a wide range of sectors . 
Attribution in this case is interesting , as the adversary appears to have made a mistake when registering its malicious domains . 
The registrant email that currently appears in the Whois records of some of the FLYING KITTEN domains is info [ @ ] usa.gov.us , however historical records show that the domains were originally registered under the email address keyvan.ajaxtm [ @ ] gmail.com . 
As FireEye 's report notes , the keyvan.ajaxtm @ gmail.com email address ties back to an Iran-based entity called Ajax Security Team . 
Earlier this year , Ajax Security had an easily identifiable presence on the Internet with its own website and related Facebook pages . 
This Internet presence has decreased significantly since early 2014 , likely due to a desire to keep a lower profile now that the group is engaged in targeted intrusion activity . 
The following Yara rules will provide detection for the adversary remote access toolkit and exfiltration tool : You can use this rule with CrowdStrike 's free CrowdResponse tool to easily scan your systems for presence of FLYING KITTEN .
