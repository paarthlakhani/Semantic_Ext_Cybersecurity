In mid-July of this year , we noticed yet another legitimate website had been compromised by APT actors and was serving malware . 
In this case , it was a group commonly referred to as `` Nitro , '' which was coined by Symantec in its 2011 whitepaper . 
As we dug deeper , we found additional compromised legitimate websites and malware from the same group back through March of this year . 
In most instances , the malware is one commonly referred to as '' Spindest , '' though we also found `` PCClient '' and `` Farfli '' variants in use by the group . 
We do n't have enough data to say for certain that all of the malware in this blog was delivered via compromised legitimate websites . 
Historically , Nitro is known for targeted spear phishing campaigns and using Poison Ivy malware , which was not seen in these attacks . 
Since at least 2013 , Nitro appears to have somewhat modified their malware and delivery methods to include Spindest and legitimate compromised websites , as reported by Cyber Squared 's TCIRT . 
Our findings indicate they are continuing to evolve with the addition of PCClient and Farfli variants . 
The Maltego screenshot below shows the activity we describe in this blog . 
These events impacted at least the following industries , across four waves : A US based IT Solutions provider ; The European office of a major , US based commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content ; A European leader in power technologies and automation for utilities and industry ; A US based provider of medical and dental imaging systems and IT solutions . 
In July , Nitro compromised a South Korean clothing and accessories manufacturer 's website to serve malware commonly referred to as `` Spindest . 
'' Of all the samples we 've tied to this activity so far noted in this blog , this is the only one configured to connect directly to an IP address for Command and Control ( C2 ) . 
This IP address has been in use by this group for some time , which is interesting since they have evolved other components of their kill chain over time to ensure malware delivery , but oddly not altered their C2 infrastructure . 
It is simple for companies to block any outbound traffic to this IP , which would negate the effort Nitro put into successfully delivering the malware . 
37 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify it , and the PE timestamp shows the day before we saw it . 
In addition , the following three samples were found roughly a week apart from each other , possibly indicating the timing of the waves of activity . 
Table 1 The next sample we found is commonly known as PCClient , which is not malware previously tied to this group . 
We discovered this , and many of the following samples , through historic IP resolution overlap between the same domains alternately resolving to either the 223.25.233.248 or 196.45.144.12 . 
The second IP has also not been reported as tied to this group before . 
However , this shifting of IP resolutions back and forth indicates Nitro is in control of these domains . 
It also makes is fairly easy for any Infosec team to reach the same conclusion we did , which again negates their use both of a previously unreported domain and IP for C2 , as well as a new family of malware . 
25 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly classify this sample as malware . 
Its PE timestamp was 8 July , almost a week prior when we first saw it . 
Table 2 The next sample was another Spindest variant and had the same timestamp as the aforementioned PcClient sample . 
In addition , Nitro chose to use the same C2 for this sample , making it easy to both find and tie to the group . 
41 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly classify this sample as malware . 
Table 3 The next wave of activity we found took place in mid-May . 
Both samples were Spindest variants with the same PE timestamp of 15 May . 
While neither MD5s for C2 match , the aforementioned link to a post by Cyber Squared 's TCIRT did document Nitro using Spindest variants with the same file name starting late December last year . 
In that case they used the historic C2 IP we note in Table 1 in this blog . 
34 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly classify the first sample as malware , and 40 AV Vendors the second sample . 
Table 4 Table 5 The malware dropped was configured to use good.myftp [ . 
] org as the C2 URL , and the IP resolution was 223.25.233.248 . 
Both of these are known Nitro Indicators of Compromise ( IOCs ) . 
In this case , the malware was a Farfli variant , again not a malware previously tied to this group . 
39 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify the file as malware . 
The PE timestamp on the file was 1 April , about two weeks before we saw the file . 
Continuing the activity , we discovered the actors had compromised a legitimate website belonging to an international technology company that provides Software Configuration and Change Management ( SCCM ) solutions in mid-May . 
( It is a well regarded company and partners with large companies such as Microsoft . 
) Table 6 The final sample , from mid-March , was also hosted on a compromised legitimate website , this time a small , US based IT company . 
The IP resolved by the C2 URL was changed two days after we saw this file to overlap with good.myftp [ . 
] org for a month before returning the below resolution . 
The filename matches that of the sample in Table 5 , which had a very similar third level C2 domain and the same IP resolution . 
This is also a Spindest variant with a PE timestamp of the same day we saw it . 
39 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify the file as malware . 
Table 7 As this post and previous cited research show , APT groups such as Nitro will continue to evolve their techniques within the kill chain to avoid detection . 
However , they also demonstrate the value of tracking these threats over time , as this allowed us to uncover and properly attribute the new IOCs because Nitro was still re-using old C2 infrastructure with their new malware . 
For Palo Alto Networks customers , all of these files were properly identified by WildFire as malware and all of the C2 domains are labeled as threats in both Threat Prevention and URL Filtering systems .
