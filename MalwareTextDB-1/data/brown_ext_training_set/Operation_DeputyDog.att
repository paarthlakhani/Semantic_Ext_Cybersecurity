FireEye has discovered a campaign leveraging the recently announced zero-day CVE-2013-3893 . 
This campaign , which we have labeled 'Operation DeputyDog ' , began as early as August 19 , 2013 and appears to have targeted organizations in Japan . 
FireEye Labs has been continuously monitoring the activities of the threat actor responsible for this campaign . 
Analysis based on our Dynamic Threat Intelligence cluster shows that this current campaign leveraged command and control infrastructure that is related to the infrastructure used in the attack on Bit9 . 
Campaign Details On September 17 , 2013 Microsoft published details regarding a new zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer that was being used in targeted attacks . 
FireEye can confirm reports that these attacks were directed against entities in Japan . 
Furthermore , FireEye has discovered that the group responsible for this new operation is the same threat actor that compromised Bit9 in February 2013 . 
FireEye detected the payload used in these attacks on August 23 , 2013 in Japan . 
The payload was hosted on a server in Hong Kong ( 210.176.3.130 ) and was named `` img20130823.jpg '' . 
Although it had a .jpg 
file extension , it was not an image file . 
The file , when XORed with 0×95 , was an executable ( MD5 : 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 ) . 
Upon execution , 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 writes `` 28542CC0.dll '' ( MD5 : 46fd936bada07819f61ec3790cb08e19 ) to this location : C : \Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\28542CC0.dll In order to maintain persistence , the original malware adds this registry key : HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\28542CC0 The registry key has this value : rundll32.exe `` C : \Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\28542CC0.dll '' , Launch The malware ( 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 ) then connects to a host in South Korea ( 180.150.228.102 ) . 
This callback traffic is HTTP over port 443 ( which is typically used for HTTPS encrypted traffic ; however , the traffic is not HTTPS nor SSL encrypted ) . 
Instead , this clear-text callback traffic resembles this pattern : POST /info.asp HTTP/1.1 Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Agtid : [ 8 chars ] 08x User-Agent : Mozilla/4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Win32 ) Host : 180.150.228.102:443 Content-Length : 1045 Connection : Keep-Alive Cache-Control : no-cache [ 8 chars ] 08x & [ Base64 Content ] The unique HTTP header `` Agtid : '' contains 8 characters followed by `` 08x '' . 
The same pattern can be seen in the POST content as well . 
A second related sample was also delivered from 111.118.21.105/css/sun.css on September 5 , 2013 . 
The sun.css file was a malicious executable with an MD5 of bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and it communicated with the same communications protocol described above to the same command and control server at 180.150.228.102 . 
We found that both droppers , bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 , were compiled on 2013-08-19 at 13:21:59 UTC . 
As we examined these files , we noticed a unique fingerprint . 
These samples both had a string that may have been an artifact of the builder used to create the binaries . 
This string was `` DGGYDSYRL '' , which we refer to as `` DeputyDog '' . 
As such , we developed the following YARA signature , based on this unique attribute : We used this signature to identify 5 other potentially related samples : Note that all of the samples , except for e9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797 , were compiled on 2013- 08-19 , within 1 second of each other . 
We pivoted off the command and control IP addresses used by these samples and found the following known malicious domains recently pointed to 180.150.228.102 . 
Links to Previous Campaigns According to Bit9 , the attackers that penetrated their network dropped two variants of the HiKit rootkit . 
One of these Hitkit samples connected to a command and control server at downloadmp3server [ . 
] servemp3 [ . 
] com that resolved to 66.153.86.14 . 
This same IP address also hosted www [ . 
] yahooeast [ . 
] net , a known malicious domain , between March 6 , 2012 and April 22 , 2012 . 
The domain yahooeast [ . 
] net was registered to 654 @ 123.com . 
This email address was also used to register blankchair [ . 
] com – the domain that we see was pointed to the 180.150.228.102 IP , which is the callback associated with sample 58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd , and has been already correlated back to the attack leveraging the CVE-2013-3893 zero-day vulnerability . 
Threat Actor Attribution Conclusion While these attackers have a demonstrated previously unknown zero-day exploits and a robust set of malware payloads , using the techniques described above , it is still possible for network defense professionals to develop a rich set of indicators that can be used to detect their attacks . 
This is the first part of our analysis , we will provide more detailed analysis on the other components of this attack in subsequent blog post .
