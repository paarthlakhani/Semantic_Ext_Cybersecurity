The attackers referred to as APT12 ( also known as IXESHE , DynCalc , and DNSCALC ) recently started a new campaign targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan . 
APT12 is believed to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People 's Liberation Army . 
APT12â€²s targets are consistent with larger People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) goals . 
Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this group are in- line with PRC goals and self-interest in Taiwan . 
Additionally , the new campaigns we uncovered further highlight the correlation between APT groups ceasing and retooling operations after media exposure , as APT12 used the same strategy after compromising the New York Times in Oct 2012 . 
Much like Darwin's theory of biological evolution , APT12 been forced to evolve and adapt in order to maintain its mission . 
The new campaign marks the first APT12 activity publicly reported since Arbor Networks released their blog `` Illuminating The Etumbot APT Backdoor . 
'' FireEye refers to the Etumbot backdoor as RIPTIDE . 
Since the release of the Arbor blog post , FireEye has observed APT12 use a modified RIPTIDE backdoor that we call HIGHTIDE . 
This is the second time FireEye has discovered APT12 retooling after a public disclosure . 
As such , FireEye believes this to be a common theme for this APT group , as APT12 will continue to evolve in an effort to avoid detection and continue its cyber operations . 
FireEye researchers also discovered two possibly related campaigns utilizing two other backdoors known as THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT . 
Both backdoors were dropped from malicious documents built utilizing the `` Tran Duy Linh '' exploit kit , which exploited CVE-2012-0158 . 
These documents were also emailed to organizations in Japan and Taiwan . 
While APT12 has previously used THREEBYTE , it is unclear if APT12 was responsible for the recently discovered campaign utilizing THREEBYTE . 
Similarly , WATERSPOUT is a newly discovered backdoor and the threat actors behind the campaign have not been positively identified . 
However , the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE campaign that we have attributed to APT12 . 
From October 2012 to May 2014 , FireEye observed APT12 utilizing RIPTIDE , a proxy-aware backdoor that communicates via HTTP to a hard-coded command and control ( C2 ) server . 
RIPTIDE 's first communication with its C2 server fetches an encryption key , and the RC4 encryption key is used to encrypt all further communication . 
In June 2014 , Arbor Networks published an article describing the RIPTIDE backdoor and its C2 infrastructure in great depth . 
The blog highlighted that the backdoor was utilized in campaigns from March 2011 till May 2014 . 
Following the release of the article , FireEye observed a distinct change in RIPTIDE 's protocols and strings . 
We suspect this change was a direct result of the Arbor blog post in order to decrease detection of RIPTIDE by security vendors . 
The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing RIPTIDE detection rules . 
FireEye dubbed this new malware family HIGHTIDE . 
On Sunday August 24 , 2014 we observed a spear phish email sent to a Taiwanese government ministry . 
Attached to this email was a malicious Microsoft Word document ( MD5 : f6fafb7c30b1114befc93f39d0698560 ) that exploited CVE-2012-0158 . 
It is worth noting that this email appeared to have been sent from another Taiwanese Government employee , implying that the email was sent from a valid but compromised account . 
The exploit document dropped the HIGHTIDE backdoor with the following properties : The HIGHTIDE backdoor connected directly to 141.108.2.157 . 
If you compare the HTTP GET request from the RIPTIDE samples ( Figure 1 ) to the HTTP GET request from the HIGHTIDE samples ( Figure 3 ) you can see the malware author changed the following items : User Agent Format and structure of the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier ( URI ) Similar to RIPTIDE campaigns , APT12 infects target systems with HIGHTIDE using a Microsoft Word ( .doc 
) document that exploits CVE-2012-0158 . 
FireEye observed APT12 deliver these exploit documents via phishing emails in multiple cases . 
Based on past APT12 activity , we expect the threat group to continue to utilize phishing as a malware delivery method . 
When the file is opened , it drops HIGHTIDE in the form of an executable file onto the infected system . 
RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE differ on several points : executable file location , image base address , the User- Agent within the GET requests , and the format of the URI . 
The RIPTIDE exploit document drops its executable file into the C : \Documents and Settings\ { user } \Application Data\Location folder while the HIGHTIDE exploit document drops its executable file into the C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\ folder . 
All but one sample that we identified were written to this folder as word.exe . 
The one outlier was written as winword.exe . 
Research into this HIGHTIDE campaign revealed APT12 targeted multiple Taiwanese Government organizations between August 22 and 28 . 
On Monday August 25 , 2014 we observed a different spear phish email sent from lilywang823 @ gmail.com to a technology company located in Taiwan . 
This spear phish contained a malicious Word document that exploited CVE-2012-0158 . 
The MD5 of the exploit document was e009b95ff7b69cbbebc538b2c5728b11 . 
Similar to the newly discovered HIGHTIDE samples documented above , this malicious document dropped a backdoor to C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\word.exe . 
This backdoor had the following properties : This backdoor sent the following callback traffic to video [ . 
] csmcpr [ . 
] com : The THREEBYTE spear phishing incident ( while not yet attributed ) shared the following characteristics with the above HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12 : The THREEBYTE backdoor was compiled two days after the HIGHTIDE backdoors . 
Both the THREEBYTE and HIGHTIDE backdoors were used in attacks targeting organizations in Taiwan . 
Both the THREEBYTE and HIGHTIDE backdoors were written to the same filepath of C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\word.exe . 
APT12 has previously used the THREEBYTE backdoor . 
On August 25 , 2014 , we observed another round of spear phishing emails targeting a high-technology company in Japan . 
Attached to this email was another malicious document that was designed to exploit CVE-2012-0158 . 
This malicious Word document had an MD5 of 499bec15ac83f2c8998f03917b63652e and dropped a backdoor to C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\word.exe . 
The backdoor had the following properties : The backdoor connects to a command and control server at icc [ . 
] ignorelist [ . 
] com . 
Similar to RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE , the WATERSPOUT backdoor is an HTTP-based backdoor that communicates with its C2 server . 
Although there are no current infrastructure ties to link this backdoor to APT12 , there are several data points that show a possible tie to the same actors : Same initial delivery method ( spear phishing email ) with a Microsoft Word Document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 . 
The same `` Tran Duy Linh '' Microsoft Word Exploit Kit was used in delivery of this backdoor . 
Similar Targets were observed where the threat actors utilized this backdoor . 
Japanese Tech Company Taiwanese Government Organizations Organizations in the Asia-Pacific Region that are of Interest to China The WATERSPOUT backdoor was written to the same file path as the HIGHTIDE backdoors : C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\word.exe C : \DOCUMENTS and SETTINGS\ { user } \LOCAL SETTINGS\Temp\winword.exe WATERSPOUT was compiled within two days of the last HIGHTIDE backdoor and on the same day as the THREEBYTE backdoor . 
Although these points do not definitively tie WATERSPOUT to APT12 , they do indicate a possible connection between the WATERSPOUT campaign , the THREEBYTE campaign , and the HIGHTIDE campaign attributed to APT12 . 
FireEye believes the change from RIPTIDE to HIGHTIDE represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while APT12 developed a completely new malware toolset . 
These development efforts may have resulted in the emergence of the WATERSPOUT backdoor . 
APT12 's adaptations to public disclosures lead FireEye to make several conclusions about this threat group : APT12 closely monitors online media related to its tools and operations and reacts when its tools are publicly disclosed . 
APT12 has the ability to adapt quickly to public exposures with new tools , tactics , and procedures ( TTPs ) . 
Public disclosures may result in an immediate change in APT12 's tools . 
These changes may be temporary and FireEye believes they are aimed at decreasing detection of their tools until a more permanent and effective TTP change can be implemented ( e.g. , WATERSPOUT ) . 
Though public disclosures resulted in APT12 adaptations , FireEye observed only a brief pause in APT12 activity before the threat actors returned to normal activity levels . 
Similarly , the public disclosure of APT12 's intrusion at the New York Times also led to only a brief pause in the threat group 's activity and immediate changes in TTPs . 
The pause and retooling by APT12 was covered in the Mandiant 2014 M- Trends report . 
Currently , APT12 continues to target organizations and conduct cyber operations using its new tools . 
Most recently , FireEye observed HIGHTIDE at multiple Taiwan-based organizations and the suspected APT12 WATERSPOUT backdoor at a Japan-based electronics company . 
We expect that APT12 will continue their trend and evolve and change its tactics to stay ahead of network defenders .
