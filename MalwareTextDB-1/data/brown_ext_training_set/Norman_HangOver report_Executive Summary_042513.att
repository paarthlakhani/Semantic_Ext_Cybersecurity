This report details a sophisticated cyberattack infrastructure that appears to originate from India , conducted by private threat actors with no evidence of state-sponsorship . 
It has likely been in operation for over three years , primarily as a platform for surveillance against targets of national security interest that are mostly based in Pakistan and possibly in the United States . 
It is also used for industrial espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civil- ian corporations . 
Evidence points to professional project management and outsourcing of key tasks , including some by freelance programmers . 
On March 17 , 2013 a Norwegian newspaper reported that the country 's telecommunications giant Telenor had filed a criminal police case for an unlawful computer intrusion . 
Spear phishing emails targeting upper management appeared to be the source of the infection Through extensive analysis , security analysts at Norman Shark in conjunction with our partners , quickly uncovered a previously unknown and sophisticated infrastructure for targeted attacks . 
The primary purpose of this long-running , global command-and-control net- work appears to be surveillance against national security interests . 
Private- ··· sector industrial espionage in fields as diverse as natural resources , telecommu- nications , law , food & restaurants , and manufacturing is likely a secondary pur- pose of this network . 
Based on analysis of IP addresses collected from criminal data stores discov- ered during the investigation , it appears that potential victims have been target- ed in over a dozen countries , most heavily represented by Pakistan , Iran , and the United States . 
Targets include government , military , and civilian organizations Spear phishing to carefully-selected target individuals was the primary attack vector identified in the investigation . 
The attackers went to great lengths to make the social engineering aspects of the attack appear as credible and applica- ble as possible . 
In many cases , decoy files and websites were used , specifically geared to the particular sensibilities of regional targets including cultural and religious sub- ject matter . 
Victims would click on what appeared to be an interesting docu- ment , and begin the long-running infection cycle . 
Despite all of the recent media attention on so-called `` zero-day '' exploits en- compassing brand new , never-before-seen attack methods , Operation Hangover appears to have relied exclusively upon well-known , previously identified vul- nerabilities in Java , Word documents , and web browsers . 
Favored methods include documents infected with malicious code , along with direction to malicious websites with names deliberately similar to legitimate government , entertainment , security related , and commercial sites . 
Often the user would be presented with a legitimate document or software download they were expecting to see , along with an unseen malicious download . 
Operation Hangover utilizes a very extensive and sophisticated command-and- control infrastructure , likely developed over many months or years by numer- ous developers . 
Our investigation revealed evidence of professional project management practices used to design frameworks , modules , and sub- components . 
Individual malware authors were assigned certain tasks , and com- ponents were `` outsourced '' to what appear to be freelance programmers . 
In recent months , much focus has been on China – including both state- sponsored and individual actors – but Operation Hangover contains notable hallmarks of originating exclusively in India . 
We base this attribution with a very high degree of confidence on our extensive analysis of IP addresses , web- site domain registrations , and text-based identifiers contained within the mali- cious code itself . 
All indications point to private syndicates of threat actors following their own motivations , with no direct evidence of state-sponsorship by the Indian government or by any other nation . 
> Discovery of a security breach at Norway-based Telenor uncovered a long running , sophisticated global cyberattack infrastructure that likely continues to this day .
