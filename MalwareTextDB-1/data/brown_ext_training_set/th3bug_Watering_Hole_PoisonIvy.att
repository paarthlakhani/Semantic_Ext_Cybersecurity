Using Poison Ivy We 've uncovered some new data and likely attribution regarding a series of APT watering hole attacks this past summer . 
Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns , as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails . 
Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors . 
These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access . 
The attacks discussed in this blog are related to an APT campaign commonly referred to as `` th3bug '' , named for the password the actors often use with their Poison Ivy malware . 
Of note , only the older of the samples we cover in this blog used that password . 
We do n't know the reason the actors changed this , but it could possibly be in reaction to information widely published on the Internet about their activities , which use that password as a key component to tie the activity together . 
FireEye in particular published a paper describing several APT campaigns whose activity they correlate using Poison Ivy passwords . 
In contrast to many other APT campaigns , which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims , '' th3bug '' is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent . 
Over the summer they compromised several sites , including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native language . 
While we were unable to recover the initial vulnerability used , it is possibly the same CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit first reported by Cisco TRAC in late July . 
We can not confirm the initial compromised sites , but we noted traffic to several known re-direct sites and the malware was configured to use the same command and control ( C2 ) server . 
In addition , the download dates of many of our files pre-date those noted by Cisco by only a few days . 
All of the malware were variants of the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool ( RAT ) and were properly identified as such by our WildFire platform . 
The targets of the attack were : Uyghur sympathizers An East Asian office for a major US based computer manufacturer A major US university An international wholesale and retail telecom provider We saw the first sample on July 14 , 2014 . 
This sample had an interesting PDB string â€“ C : \Users\sophie\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\init\Release\init.pdb with a time date string that exactly matched the PE timestamp of 11 July , 2014 . 
Table 1 The next day we collected several copies of the same malware intended for the same industry . 
They were downloaded from one of the download URLs in the below table , but all had the same MD5 and C2 domain . 
Table 2 On July 16 WildFire picked up a malicious executable hosted on uyghurweb.net , a legitimate Uyghur website that was compromised to infect users . 
The file was named `` PYvBte.jar '' but was actually a Windows executable . 
The file has the characteristics listed in Table 3 , and appears to be a stand-alone executable version of the Metasploit Meterpreter shell . 
When this file runs , it downloads a payload from uyghurweb.net/player/gmuweb.exe and executes it . 
This file is the same Poison Ivy RAT described in Table 2 . 
The Meterpreter payload masquerades as a copy of the ApacheBench tool made by the Apache Software Foundation . 
Table 3 On 21 July , we detected another sample that was noted in the Cisco TRAC blog . 
The initial download URL and IP resolution were different than the previous samples , but the C2 domain and resolution matched . 
This file is also a Poison Ivy variant . 
Table 4 Based on historical IP resolution overlaps between the above C2 domains and other domains that have also resolved to the same IPs , we found an additional sample from the beginning of this year . 
Interestingly , the first sample was not logged in VirusTotal prior to our submission , despite the sample having been in use in the wild for at least seven months . 
In addition , it is the only sample tied to this activity we found that used the Poison Ivy password `` th3bug '' . 
AVAST wrote a blog related to the activity we describe here and tied a file with the same name , but the sample we found does n't match any other details of the file they documented . 
Also of note , the IP resolution for this C2 domain was changed to match the IP resolution of the C2 domains used in the July activity only a few days after these samples were seen . 
Additionally , the files PE timestamp was January 21 , the day before we detected the sample . 
Targeted industries for this series are listed below . 
Another international wholesale and retail telecom provider A major visual computing company headquartered in the US A state-owned East Asian financial services company Table 5 Watering hole attacks will continue to be popular with APT campaigns , as they are much harder to defend against then spear phishing attacks . 
There is no way for people browsing to these websites to know in advance the normally trusted website has been compromised and will serve them malware when they visit it . 
Ensuring web browsers and operating system software is fully patched and up-to-date is the best way to defend against this type of threat . 
However , to increase success rates APT campaigns can use zero-day exploits , so even a properly patched system would be compromised . 
Palo Alto Networks users should use our firewall 's ability to block executable downloads unless the user specifically authorizes it . 
If you want to allow executables through but prefer that they be analyzed for malicious activity , use our WildFire platform , which correctly identified all of the files listed in this blog as malware and provides users with a full report on the samples host and network-based activities .
