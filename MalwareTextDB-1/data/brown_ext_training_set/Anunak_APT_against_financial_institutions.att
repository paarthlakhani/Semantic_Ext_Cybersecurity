The information published in this report may be used by interested parties at their discretion provided they make reference to Group-IB and Fox-IT . 
This report describes the details and type of op- erations carried out by an organized criminal group that focuses on financial industry , such as banks and payment providers , retail industry and news , media and PR companies . 
The group has its origin in more common financial fraud including theft from con- sumer and corporate bank accounts in Europe and Russia , using standard banking malware , mainly Carberp . 
After the arrests of Carberp group members in Russia , some of the members were out of work , however , their experience gained from many years of crime has allowed them to enter a new niche . 
One of the members quickly realized that they can steal $ 2000 a thousand times , and earn $ 2 million , but also they can steal it in one time and immediately get it with much less effort . 
The anti-fraud measures employed by banks has pushed the criminals to search for new ways to make money with less bar- riers , compromising and modifying or taking data from banks , payment providers , retail and media/ PR companies are some of these methods . 
From 2013 an organized criminal group intensi- fied its activity focused on banks and electronic pay- ment systems in Russia and in the post-Soviet space . 
The key is that fraud occurs within the corporate network using internal payment gateways and in- ternal banking systems . 
Thus money is stolen from the banks and payment systems , and not from their customers . 
While this is their main and most lucra- tive activity , the gang has also ventured into other areas including the compromise of media groups and other organizations for industrial espionage and likely a trading advantage on the stock market . 
In cases where the group got access to the government agency networks their aim was espionage related . 
The organized criminal group backbone are citizens of both Russian and Ukrainian origin , but the group also sources a number of mainstream and specialized services from individuals and groups originating from Russia , Ukraine and Belarus . 
The average sum of theft in the Russian terri- tory and in the post-Soviet space is $ 2 million per incident . 
Since 2013 they have successfully gained access to networks of more than 50 Russian banks and 5 payment systems , and 2 of these institutions were deprived of their banking license . 
To date the total amount of theft is over 1 billion rubles ( about 25 million dollars ) , most of it has been stolen in the second half of 2014 . 
The average time from the moment of penetration into the financial institutions internal network till successful theft is 42 days . 
As a result of access to internal bank networks the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM management infrastructure and infect those sys- tems with their own malicious software that further allows theft from the banks ATM systems on the attackers command . 
Since 2014 the organized criminal group mem- bers began actively taking an interest in US and Eu- ropean based retail organizations . 
While they were already familiar with POS malware and compromis- ing POS terminals , the widespread media attention around the Target breach and other related breaches were the reason for this move . 
While the scale of breaches in this industry is still relatively low , with at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen retailers compromised this activity is quickly becom- ing a lucrative endeavor for this group . 
To penetrate into the internal networks this organized criminal group employs targeted emailing ( spear phishing ) and infections sources from other botnets . 
This is the main reason why the group is keeping in touch with owners of large botnets . 
Since August 2014 the group began to create their own large botnet using a mass emailing , but not using typical exploit driveby infections . 
This last move is likely to reduce the need for external contacts . 
The first successful bank robbery was committed by this group in January 2013 . 
In all first cases the attackers used the program RDPdoor for remote access to the bank network and the program `` MBR Eraser '' to remove traces and to crack Windows computers and servers . 
Both programs were used by the members of the Carberp criminal group under the guidance of a person named Germes . 
To reduce the risk of losing access to the internal bank network the attackers , in addition to malicious programs , were also used for remote access legitimate pro- grams such as Ammy Admin and Team Viewer . 
Lat- er the attackers completely abandoned from usage of RDPdoor and Team Viewer . 
In addition to banking and payment systems , hackers got access to e-mail servers to control all internal communications . 
This approach allowed them to find out that the anomalous activity in the bank network was identified , what technique was used to identify this activity and what measures the bank employees took to solve the problem . 
Email control was successfully installed regardless of used email system , MS Exchange or Lotus . 
This approach allowed them to take countermeasures that created for bank and payment system employees the feeling that the problem had been solved . 
The main steps of the attack progression are the following ones : 1 . 
Primary infection of an ordinary employee computer . 
2 . 
Getting a password of a user with administra- tive rights on some computers . 
For example , a password of a technical support engineer . 
3 . 
Gaining legitimate access to one server . 
4 . 
Compromising the domain administrator password from the server . 
5 . 
Gaining access to the domain controller and compromising of all active domain accounts . 
6 . 
Gaining access to e-mail and workflow servers . 
7 . 
Gaining access to server and banking system administrator workstations . 
8 . 
Installing the software to monitor activity of interesting system operators . 
Usually photo and video recording was used . 
9 . 
Configuring remote access to servers of inter- est including firewall configuration changes . 
To carry out target attacks in 2014 the hackers have finalized development of their core malware Anunak that is used along with the following tools : According to our laboratory classification the main malware is `` Anunak '' . 
This trojan is used for target attacks only , mainly on banks and payment systems . 
Target usage of this program allows it to remain poorly explored , providing it a good surviv- ability inside corporate networks . 
The source code of the bank trojan program Carberp was used in some places of this malware . 
`` Anunak '' has the following feature set : • The software called `` Mimikatz '' is built in this program . 
This is an open source software that al- lows to obtain passwords of user accounts logged in the Windows system . 
However , this software was considerably changed : while maintaining the capability to get account passwords the functions of user interaction and of information output for errors and program execution were eliminated . 
Thus , when the malicious program is executed on the server , it will secretly compromise all the domain and local accounts , including adminis- trator accounts . 
To get account passwords it is sufficient to enter two commands in succession : `` privilege : :debug '' and `` sekurlsa : :logonpass- words '' . 
When this program is executed on a domain controller or an e-mail server it compro- mises virtually all the domain accounts , includ- ing administrators . 
• There is also the possibility to add a file into the firewall exclusion list by creating the correspond- ing rule with the utility `` Netsh '' . 
• The functions of keypress grabber as well as the function of screenshot creation are implemented in the program . 
• There are also the functions to interact with the bank system iFOBS . 
• The malware sends key information , screenshots and CAB-archives to its management server . 
• The program is able to secretly make changes to a number of system files , presumably to remove the limitations of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems on the number of users that may simultaneously connect to the correspond- ing PC using RDP to administer it remotely . 
There is the ability to download arbitrary exe- cutable files from the management server and run them . 
One of these files is the program `` AmmyAd- min '' that may be run with the arguments `` -service '' and `` -nogui '' that force it to start as a service without user interface . 
`` AmmyAdmin '' allows to connect with another computer that has the same software through the server `` rl.ammyy.com '' using the IP address and the unique identifier . 
As a result , the attacker gets remote access to the user computer with the running program `` AmmyAdmin '' bypassing firewalls . 
The window screenshot is shown in the figure below : When the attackers gain access to servers running operating systems of the Linux family they use SSH backdoor that transmits to the malicious server the login/password data used to access the servers and provides attackers remote access to the servers . 
To provide access to the server of interest the at- tackers may appropriately modify rules for firewalls Microsoft TMG , CISCO , etc . 
When the attackers yet had no major malware that would secretly install the program `` AmmyAd- min '' and report to the attackers a remote access password , they used a malicious program known as `` Barus '' . 
This malware is used rarely and the last time we met it in 2013 . 
This malicious program is developed by Russian-speaking authors . 
In the control panel you can notice a field `` Ammy ID '' , its usage allowed the attackers to connect remotely . 
At the very beginning of their activity in 2013 due to lack of the target Trojan the attackers began to distribute Andromeda and Pony . 
They distributed these malware using Driveby through a bunch of Neutrino Exploit Kit exploits as shown in the figure below . 
It is interesting that in the autumn 2013 they used the site http : //php.net/ as traffic source to Magnitude EK . 
They redirected the traffic from this resource since July 2013 , but this fact was discov- ered much later . 
The name of one of the streams to distribute the malware is `` LOL BANK FUCKIUNG '' that corresponded to the attacker activities . 
Parallel to this technique they also use another infection method , which was one of the principal methods . 
The main method of distribution is send- ing emails with malicious attachments on behalf of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation , a poten- tial client or an real counterparty ( at first the attack- ers had cracked this counterparty account , then they used emailing with the cracked contact list ) . 
Another used method is to install a special malware to carry out targeted attacks via another malware that might appear in the local network by accident . 
To find such malicious programs the criminal group keeps in touch with several owners of large botnets that massively distributes their mal- ware . 
The attackers buy from these botnet owners the information about IP-addresses of computers where the botnet owners have installed malware and then check whether the IP-address belongs to the financial and government institutions . 
If the mal- ware is in the subnet of interest , the attackers pay the large botnet owner for installation of their target malware . 
Such partner relations were established with owners of botnets Zeus , Shiz Ranbyus . 
All of these trojans are bank Trojans , their usage is ex- plained by the previously established relationships . 
In late 2013 the hacker under the alias Dinhold be- gan to build his own botnet using modified Carberp , having uploaded its source code for public access . 
The attackers were trying to create similar relations with this hacker , but in 2014 he was arrested , having not developed his botnet up to the required level . 
To check whether the IP-address belongs to the desired network the following script is used : The most dangerous emailings are those that are sent on behalf of partners with whom financial and government institutions communicates permanently by email . 
An example of such emailing occurred on Septem- ber 25 , 2014 , at 14:11 , from the e-mail address `` Elina Shchekina < e.shekina @ rbkmoney.com > '' with the subject `` Updated agree- ment version '' . 
The attachment '' agreement.doc '' exploits the vul- nerability CVE-2012-2539 and CVE-2012-0158 . 
The emailing was conducted for more than 70 addresses of various compa- nies ( where multiple recipient addresses may be within one company ) . 
The letter with malicious attachment ( md5 : AA36BA9F- 4DE5892F1DD427B7B2100B06 ) in the archive with a password from a potential client was sent to a bank manager after a pre- liminary telephone conversation with him . 
The call origin is Saint Petersburg .

There were also other exam- ples of emails with malicious attachments , such as emailing with the file `` 001. photo.exe '' . 
A more detailed list of such attachments you can see in the Table `` Email attachments '' . 
Availability of access to bank internal networks opens great opportunities for the hackers . 
One of these opportunities is access to ATMs from spe- cial network segments that had to be isolated . 
It is confirmed that this criminal group gained access to 52 ATMs . 
The amount of damage exceeds 50 million rubles . 
As a result of access to ATMs , depending on the ATM model , hackers used different patterns . 
Having access , the attackers downloaded mali- cious scripts and changed denominations of issued banknotes in the ATM operating system registry . 
As a result , for query to get 10 notes with denomination of 100 roubles the attackers received 10 banknotes with denomination of 5,000 roubles . 
The used malicious script and program were developed for the platform Wincor . 
The malicious script contains the following commands : Contents of the file `` 1.bat '' Execution of this file changed registry keys in the registry branch `` '' HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SOFTWARE\Wincor Nixdorf\ProTopas\Current- Version\LYNXPAR\CASH_DISPENSER '' '' that are responsible for cassette denominations in an ATM . 
As a result of this file execution the registry key that is in charge of the cassette number 1 ( VALUE_1 ) is takes the value `` 100 '' , and the registry key respon- sible for the cassette number 4 ( VALUE_4 ) is set to '' 5000 '' . 
Then the command to restart the computer is issued . 
The registry key reference values : If the ATM actual load corresponds to the refer- ence one and registry keys have been changed , then the banknotes from the cassette No.1 will be issued with denomination `` 5000 '' instead of `` 100 '' . 
In addition , the attackers used a modified debug program that allows by the command to issue mon- ey from the dispenser . 
The original debug program issues money through the dispenser only when the open ATM housing and the vault door are fixed . 
In order to ensure money issuance from the closed ATM the attackers had to modify the original program `` KDIAG32 '' ( the original file : size of 1,128,960 MD5 4CC1A6E049942EB- DA395244C74179EFF ) . 
A comparison of the original version of the pro- gram with the modified version showed that the only difference is in ignoring error `` '' Door not opened or missing ! '' '' . 
The figure below shows an error message that will be never displayed to the user in the file under investigation . 
All traces found during investigation of one incident showed that the same criminal group had worked . 
Ammy Admin was used for remote access , the same SSHD backdoor was installed on Unix servers and , In addi- tion , it was loaded from the same hacked server as in other cases of trojan Anunak usage . 
However , in this case Androm- eda is used as the main trojan instead of Anunak . 
The man- agement servers were located in Kazakhstan , Germany and Ukraine . 
Check of the manage- ment servers showed that it was the hosting Bulletproof that , in addition to servers , provides a service of traffic proxying through its infrastructure as well as TOR and VPN usage , so this pattern is significantly differs from the Anunak host- ing patern . 
Check of money cashout showed that the same cashout criminal group had worked as for Anunak and this fact again confirmed their cooperation . 
Obtained Andromeda trojan copies were being distributed from August 2014 by e-mail . 
The value 754037e7be8f61cbb1b85ab46c7da77d , which is the MD5 hash of the string `` go fuck yourself '' , was used as the RC4 encryption key . 
As a result of this distri- bution from August to late October the Andromeda botnet rose up to 260,000 bots . 
Successful infection in one subnet resulted in sending such letters to other bank employees . 
Example of forwarding from an infected bank network to employees of another bank is shown below . 
As a result of this radial mailing many oil and gas companies , banks and government agencies were in- fected . 
In Russia at least 15 banks and two payment systems were infected this way . 
Letters with similar attachments were being dis- tributed with the following subjects : `` My new photo '' `` Alert Transactions Report by users from 2014- 09-28 to 2014-09-28 '' Previously , it should be noted the fact that the process of stolen money withdrawal ( cashout ) was differed , firstly by the theft method , secondly by the victim type ( a bank or a payment system ) , thirdly by the total stolen sum . 
The victims by their type were divided rather by counterparty types and by limitations imposed by operation with the counterparties . 
For example , all payments were required to go through a certain pool of mediators . 
In addition , the `` improper '' pool of counterparties could cause suspicion and unneces- sary testing ( manual processing of payment orders ) . 
Bank ( amounts up to 100 million roubles ) : • When the attackers had obtained control of a bank operator workstation ( attacker purpose ) , they in general used a classic tree scheme when funds from the bank account were sent to several legal entities , then from each legal entity to smaller legal entities ( may be several such iter- ations ) and then to private person credit cards ( from 600 to 7000 transactions ) . 
• When the attackers had obtained control of ATM management service ( attacker purpose ) , money were withdrawn directly from the ATM by the at- tacker command . 
In this case the whole cashout process consisted in that a drop person had to be near the ATM at the specified time with a bag to empty the dispenser . 
Bank ( amounts from 100 million roubles ) : • Money was sent to accounts of other banks , and cracked banks were often used where accounts and credit cards had been prepared in advance . 
Payment system : • In addition to all the above methods , cash sending channels were also employed through the settlements systems , electronic wallets and payment systems , such as web money , Yandex Money , QIWI ( 1500-2000 transactions ) . 
Reve- nues of large amounts ( up to 50 million roubles ) were recorded to particular cards of private per- sons who then used these cards to buy expensive small-sized goods such as jewelry , watches , and other attributes . 
A huge part of the money was sent through mobile operators ( 1500-2000 SIM cards prepared in advance ) . 
• In spring 2014 ( high time of this fraud type ) 2 cashout person groups were known who support- ed target attacks , by autumn 2014 their number increased to 5 . 
In general , this increase was due to number of thefts too ( number of victims + average stolen sum per 1 victim ) . 
The groups are working in different cities to ensure better cashout distribution . 
Also these groups include immigrants from former Soviet republics who if necessary arrive in the required city . 
Each group was monitored by a separate person . 
Each group consists of about 15-20 people . 
• Part of the money was transferred to Ukraine and Belarus . 
While the attacks in Russia against banks and payment systems have occurred over the past two years , the attacks against the retail industry is only something which started in the second quarter of 2014 . 
With at least three confirmed breaches where card track data was obtainedand a total of at least 16 breaches at retail organizations , it is also becoming a serious threat . 
Apart from retail organizations it is also known that a number of media and PR companies have been breached in 2014 . 
While it is not entirely cer- tain , the type of breaches suggest that the attackers are looking for inside information , a type of indus- trial espionage , allowing them to gain an advantage on the stock market . 
As there is nothing specifically missing and the resulting fraud is hard to match with anything , these incidents typically are never linked . 
From the retail perspective , the first infections in 2014 were sourced from a botnet which employs a widely deployed crypto-currency mining malware based on the Gozi/ISFB ( banking ) malware family . 
Based on our insights we believe during the first half of 2014 over half a million systems had been compromised by this malware from over the whole world , however Russia and a number of post-Soviet states were clean of infections . 
To find interesting infections within this large set of compromised systems , the malware extracts relevant information from the systems including Microsoft Windows organization registration information and network/ Windows domain information . 
The Gozi/ISFB based malware was used to drop additional components on interesting systems , which included Metasploit/Meterpreter payloads and Anunak variants . 
This was one of the main methods for the group using Anunak to obtain in- teresting infections in the middle of 2014 , sourcing infections from other botnet operators.More recent- ly other infection methods , including spear phishing using English language and possibly also usage of the teams own Andromeda , but also SQL injection to breach an organization directly from the outside , has been employed by this team . 
The first known attacks with Anunak targeted a specific brand of POS systems which revolved around the Epicor/NSB brand . 
To do this Anunak has specific code to target POS devices equipped with this software , which in contrary to the more common memory scanning track data scrapers , logs a wealth of information from the payments done by the cards . 
The first case this was seen active was in July 2014 , but it might have been earlier as well . 
More recent breaches have used a new custom developed POS malware , which is a more simple but reliable track data memory scraper . 
The initial version from the early fall of 2014 used a simple blacklist , scraped every process and dumped track data in plain text . 
More recent versions scanned only configuration specified processes and used RC4 to encrypt the extracted track data records on disk . 
While the retail industry is one of its main targets due to its payment processing capabilities , other compromises might occur indirectly , for example to obtain databases with information or other informa- tion that is of value to the organized criminal group . 
One of the possibilities is obtaining lists of corporate email addresses to have a higher chance of interest- ing infections . 
At this moment we have no evidence of successful compromise or theft of banks and payment systems outside of Russia , but several infections in the east of Europe ( specifically Ukraine and Latvia ) were active in 2014 . 
These specific infections were related to infrastructure of organizations based in Russia or with significant interests in Russia , thus more likely related to the breaches at the same organization in Russia . 
The majority of infections from Europe were from dedicated servers used as exit node for VPN services , the systems infected were likely from Eastern Euro- pean or Russian origin , and possibly test infections from the attackers . 
We have no evidence of compro- mises against banks in Western Europe or United States , but it should be noted that the attackers methods could be utilized against banks outside of Russia as well . 
The group uses Metasploit as one of their main hacking tools , either stand alone or as part of a framework . 
The activity includes port scanning and system reconnaissance , escalating privileges on systems by using for example the recent CVE-2014- 4113 vulnerability , gathering credentials and hop- ping on to other systems and networks . 
Metasploit is being used to its full potential with scanning , exploiting , privilege escalation and post exploitation persistence being achieved with its standard toolset . 
On interesting and critical systems typical hack- ing tools might be found to establish tunnels out of the network , either tools that are part of the Metasploit framework such as Meterpreter , but also other tools to achieve persistence on those systems . 
The connect back methods seen are typically SSL over port 443 , but also DNS based methods were observed . 
The attackers use BITS to download files , but also make use of Windows built-in PowerShell to download tools and execute commands . 
Finally on the critical systems freshly crypted and non-detected versions of Anunak are deployed , typically these are used in very limited deployments thus their spread is limited and detection by Anti-Virus is very rare . 
Various stealth methods including the aforemen- tioned backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for compromise persistence and data exfiltration are used . 
The Anunak malware has multiple ways of connecting to backends , which includes a PHP based backend reachable over HTTP and HTTPS , and a Windows server based component using a propri- etary protocol . 
The use of VNC scanning and password brute forcing , the adding of additional administrator accounts , use of RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent RDP sessions are all methods to gain access and achieve persistent access to compromised systems employed by this group . 
Additionally various ways of creating incidental and regular screen captures of the desktop of persons of interest within com- promised organizations were methods employed by these attackers . 
This also includes video captures made by the Anunak malware , allowing attackers to observe the behavior of users of certain applications .
